Mathematically, we show that the three dimensional gravity can be described by Schramm-Loewner Evolution(SLE) with certain $\\kappa$. In fact, SLE depends on the parameter $\\kappa$ which controls the diffusion of the Brownian motion. %Each value of $c < 1$ corresponds to two values of $\\kappa$ which are represented by two different phases. Each value of $c < 1$ corresponds to two values of $\\kappa$, which may hint that the three dimensional gravity has two different phases at certain central charge c. Moreover, phase transition is also discussed in AdS and Ising model.",
