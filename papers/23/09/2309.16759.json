    "tldr": "该文章详细分析了在1-Higgs-singlet扩展的Standard Model中，$pp$对撞产生的$t\\bar{t}$对生产过程，其中包含了额外的重Higgs粒子$h_2$与轻Higgs粒子$h_1$的混合。该过程受到与QCD连续背景产生的大幅度干涉效应影响，特别是通过链条诱导的Higgs介导的振幅与中间重Higgs共振贡献之间的大干涉。为了可靠地建模这些干涉效应对后黎曼度数的影响，文章计算了矩阵元的NLO修正，并纠正了对整个人群的影响，包括高阶的QCD修正和重Higgs的中性质量形状要求。文章还指出了有效期内的非可分两环图的模糊处理，并给出了几个基准点下的数值结果，包括重Higgs质量的700-3000GeV范围，考虑到干涉效应和QCD修正在未来的实验中可能的信号识别和解释。"
