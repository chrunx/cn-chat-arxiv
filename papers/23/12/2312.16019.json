We introduce a robust loss function and use CROWN-IBP regularization to handle computational challenges in the Min-Max problem.

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种使用对抗性正则化的鲁棒的生存分析方法，该方法通过引入新的鲁棒损失函数和利用CROWN-IBP正则化来处理Min-Max问题中的计算挑战，从而为全参数的生存模型提供了鲁棒性。通过在SurvSet数据集上的实验，文章展示了所提出的Survival Analysis with Adversarial Regularization（SAWAR）方法在面对各种扰动时，在负对数 likelihood（NegLL）、集成贝济尔分数（IBS）和一致性指数（CI）等方面均取得了对基线的显著优势，验证了对抗性正则化提高了生存分析的性能。"
