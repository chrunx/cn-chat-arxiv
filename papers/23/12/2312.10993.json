Our method integrates 3D and 2D information using a shared transformer network within the training of the diffusion model, unifying motion noise into a single feature space. This enables cross-decoding of features into both 3D and 2D motion representations, regardless of their original dimension. The primary advantage of CrossDiff is its cross-diffusion mechanism, which allows the model to reverse either 2D or 3D noise into clean motion during training. This capability leverages the complementary information in both motion representations, capturing intricate human movement details often missed by models relying solely on 3D information. Consequently, CrossDiff effectively combines the strengths of both representations to generate more realistic motion sequences. In our experiments,",

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种结合了三维和二维信息的跨扩散模型（CrossDiff），能够生成高质量的人类运动序列。该模型通过在训练过程中整合3D和2D信息，并使用共享的Transformer网络，统一了运动噪声特征空间。通过跨扩散机制，该模型能够将2D或3D噪声逆向转换回清晰的运动，从而在训练过程中捕捉到更细腻的人类动作细节。因此，CrossDiff能够在生成更真实的人类运动序列的同时，有效整合两种信息源的优势。"
