We exemplify our approach on the State of the Union speeches given by the past 42 US presidents: this dataset is known for its relatively small amount of data, and high variability of the amount and style of texts. Nevertheless we manage to achieve about 95\\% accuracy on the authorship attribution task, and pin down the date of writing to a single presidential term.",
