While many works have focused on generating 3D human models, they suffer one or more of the following: lack of distinctive features, unnatural shading/shadows, unnatural poses/clothes, limited views, etc. InceptionHuman achieves consistent 3D human generation within a progressively refined NeRF space with two novel modules, Iterative Pose-Aware Refinement (IPAR) and Progressive-Augmented Reconstruction (PAR). IPAR iteratively refines the diffusion-generated images and synthesizes high-quality 3D-aware views considering the close-pose RGB values. PAR employs a pretrained diffusion prior to augment the generated synthetic views and adds regularization for view-independent appearance. Overall, the synth",

    "tldr": "该文章提出的InceptionHuman框架通过结合不同模态的指令输入（如文本、姿态、边缘、分割图等），能够控制生成具有高保真度的3D人类模型。该框架实现了在不具有独特特征、不自然的阴影、不自然的姿势/服饰、有限的视角等问题的同时，逐步细化神经辐射场空间，并利用两个新颖模块——迭代姿态感知精修（IPAR）和渐进式增强重建（PAR），实现了3D人类模型的稳定生成。"
