However, maintaining homeostasis within these networks is challenging, as it requires continuous adjustment of neural responses to preserve equilibrium and optimal processing efficiency amidst diverse and often unpredictable input signals. In response to these challenges, we propose the Asynchronous Bioplausible Neuron (ABN), a dynamic spike firing mechanism to auto-adjust the variations in the input signal. Comprehensive evaluation across various datasets demonstrates ABN's enhanced performance in image classification and segmentation, maintenance of neural equilibrium, and energy efficiency.",
