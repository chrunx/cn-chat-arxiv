In this paper, we proposed a SE-Stacking model based on information fusion and ensemble learning for user purchase behavior prediction. After successfully utilizing the ensemble feature selection method to screen purchase-related factors, we used the Stacking algorithm for user purchase behavior prediction. In our efforts to avoid the deviation of prediction results, we optimized the model by selecting ten different kinds of models as base learners and modifying relevant parameters specifically for them. The experiments conducted on a publicly-available dataset shows that the SE-Stacking model can achieve a 98.40% F1-score, about 0.09% higher than the optimal base models. The SE-Stacking model not only has a good ",
