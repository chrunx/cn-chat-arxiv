Specifically, we employ an explicit construction of the BPS quiver for the case of full regular punctures to show that the defect group is $(\\mathbb{Z}_N)^{2g}$, where $g$ is the genus of the associated Riemann surface. This determines a sector of surface operators in the 5d symmetry TFT. We show how these can also be identified from dimensional reduction of M-theory.",
