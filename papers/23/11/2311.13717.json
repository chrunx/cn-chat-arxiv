A recent trend is to adapt FID to medical imaging through feature extractors trained on medical images. Our study challenges this practice by demonstrating that ImageNet-based extractors are more consistent and aligned with human judgment than their RadImageNet counterparts. We evaluated sixteen StyleGAN2 networks across four medical imaging modalities and four data augmentation techniques with Fr\\'echet distances (FDs) computed using eleven ImageNet or RadImageNet-trained feature extractors. Comparison with human judgment via visual Turing tests revealed that ImageNet-based extractors produced rankings consistent with human judgment, with the FD derived from the ImageNet-trained SwAV extractor significantly correlating with expert eval",

    "tldr": "该文章指出，尽管医学图像生成模型的新趋势是采用专门针对医疗图像的feature extractors，但研究结果表明，基于ImageNet的feature extractors在评估合成图像质量时更可靠且与人类判断一致，尤其是在使用SwAV提取器时，其计算的Fr\\'echet距离与专家评估结果有着显著的相关性。"
