However, in current SC systems, the construction of the knowledge base (KB) faces several issues, including limited knowledge representation, frequent knowledge updates, and insecure knowledge sharing. Fortunately, the development of the large AI model (LAM) provides new solutions to overcome the above issues. Here, we propose a LAM-based SC framework (LAM-SC) specifically designed for image data, where we first apply the segment anything model (SAM)-based KB (SKB) that can split the original image into different semantic segments by universal semantic knowledge. Then, we present an attention-based semantic integration (ASI) to weigh the semantic segments generated by SKB without human participation and integrate them as the semantic aware image.

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种基于巨大人工智能模型（LAM）的 semantic 通信（SC）框架，该框架能够通过分割任何模型（SAM）将图像分为不同的语义段并自动集成这些段，实现了无需人类参与的语义感知图像的构建，从而解决了现有SC系统中知识库（KB）建设的局限性、频繁更新和安全知识共享问题。"
