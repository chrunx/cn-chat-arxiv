Text-to-image generation, in particular, has become vastly popular and millions of practitioners produce AI-generated images and AI art online. This chapter first gives an overview of the key developments that enabled a healthy co-creative online ecosystem around text-to-image generation to rapidly emerge, followed by a high-level description of key elements in this ecosystem. A particular focus is placed on prompt engineering, a creative practice that has been embraced by the AI art community. It is then argued that the emerging co-creative ecosystem constitutes an intelligent system on its own - a system that both supports human creativity, but also potentially entraps future generations and limits future development efforts in AI.
