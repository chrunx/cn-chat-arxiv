We present a path-integral approach \\`a la Martin-Siggia-Rose-De Dominicis-Janssen (MSRDJ) to analyse nonequilibrium phase transitions in such dynamical systems. As an illustration, we apply our framework to the adaptation of gene-regulatory networks under a dynamic genotype-phenotype map: phenotypic variations are shaped by the fast stochastic gene-expression dynamics and are coupled to the slowly evolving distribution of genotypes, each encoded by a network structure. We establish that under this map, genotypes corresponding to reciprocal networks of coherent feedback loops are selected within an intermediate range of environmen",
