    "title": "3D Structure-guided Network for Tooth Alignment in 2D Photograph",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2310.11106v2 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: Orthodontics focuses on rectifying misaligned teeth (i.e., malocclusions), affecting both masticatory function and aesthetics. However, orthodontic treatment often involves complex, lengthy procedures. As such, generating a 2D photograph depicting aligned teeth prior to orthodontic treatment is crucial for effective dentist-patient communication and, more importantly, for encouraging patients to accept orthodontic intervention. In this paper, we propose a 3D structure-guided tooth alignment network that takes 2D photographs as input (e.g., photos captured by smartphones) and aligns the teeth within the 2D image space to generate an orthodontic comparison photograph featuring aesthetically pleasing, aligned teeth. Notably, while the process operates within a 2D image space, our method employs 3D intra-oral scanning models collected in clinics to learn about orthodontic treatment, i.e., projecting the pre- and post-orthodontic 3D tooth",
