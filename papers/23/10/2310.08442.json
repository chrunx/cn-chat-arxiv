Specifically, we offer theoretical insights that the prevailing constant loss weight strategy in $\\epsilon$-prediction of diffusion models leads to biased estimation during the training phase, hindering accurate estimations of original images. To address the issue, we propose a simple but effective weighting strategy derived from the unlocked biased part.
