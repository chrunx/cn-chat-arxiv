Being able to discover objects in images/videos without knowing in advance what objects populate the dataset is an exciting prospect. But how to find objects without knowing anything about them? Recent works show that it is possible to perform class-agnostic unsupervised object localization by exploiting self-supervised pre-trained features. We propose here a survey of unsupervised object localization methods that discover objects in images without requiring any manual annotation in the era of self-supervised ViTs.
