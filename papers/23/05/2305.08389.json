However, existing works suffer from two shortcomings: 1) the control signal is single-grained which can not satisfy diverse user intentions; 2) the video description is generated in a single round which can not be further edited to meet dynamic needs. In this paper, we propose a novel \\textbf{V}ideo \\textbf{C}aption \\textbf{E}diting \\textbf{(VCE)} task to automatically revise an existing video description guided by multi-grained user requests. Inspired by human writing-revision habits, we design the user command as a pivotal triplet \\{\\textit{operation, position, attribute}\\} to cover diverse user needs from coarse-grained to fine-grained. To facilitate the VCE task, we \\textit{automatically} construct an open-domain benchmark dataset named VATEX-EDIT ",

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一个名为VATEX-EDIT的开放领域基准数据集，用于自动修订现有视频描述，以适应用户的多层次请求。用户请求被设计为由“操作、位置和属性”组成的精炼三元组，实现了从粗粒度到细粒度的用户需求覆盖。通过这种方式，该任务允许用户对视频描述进行动态编辑和修订，从而满足不同的用户意图。"
