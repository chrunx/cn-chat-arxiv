We show that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end.

    "tldr": "该文章探索了在环境约束下，信息传递过程中符号意义的语境依赖性得到发展的条件。研究基于经典信号理论，证明了在有限词汇量的情景下，交流者能够通过识别信号并作出反应来实现有效的信息传递。同时，文章还探讨了环境因素和接收者的认知能力如何促进对符号意义的语境性解释，并指出在不具备语境解释能力的情况下，接收者对环境的感知也无法阻止利用环境的接收者对信号作出正确反应。研究提出，接收者对语境的意识是实现有效语境依赖式交流的前提条件。"
