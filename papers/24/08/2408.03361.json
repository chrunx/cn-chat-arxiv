In the medical field, LVLMs have a high potential to offer substantial assistance for diagnosis and treatment. Before that, it is crucial to develop benchmarks to evaluate LVLMs' effectiveness in various medical applications. Current benchmarks are often built upon specific academic literature, mainly focusing on a single domain, and lacking varying perceptual granularities. Thus, they face specific challenges, including limited clinical relevance, incomplete evaluations, and insufficient guidance for interactive LVLMs. To address these limitations, we developed the GMAI-MMBench, the most comprehensive general medical AI benchmark with well-categorized data structure and multi-perceptual granularity to date. It is constructed from 285 datasets across 39 medical image mod",
