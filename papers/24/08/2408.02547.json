    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2408.02547v1 公告类型：新摘要：准确的手势感知模型对于各种机器人应用的发展至关重要，它直接影响到神经机器人学和互动机器人的能力。最近，表面肌电图（sEMG）因其丰富的信息上下文和与先进机器学习方法及可穿戴系统的兼容性而被探索，用以提高各种基于sEMG的神经机器人感知模型的性能，同时确保其对于使用sEMG的神经机器人的鲁棒性。文献中提出了许多提高性能的方法，这些方法虽然确保了模型的高效性，但在实际应用中往往需要较强的计算能力、大规模的数据集和可扩展性较低的解决方案。本文通过提出从肌肉同步而非肌肉个体激活中解码信息的方法，来解决上述挑战。我们对功能性肌肉网络背后的肌肉同步进行了一定程度的理解，提出一种基于一致性功能肌肉网络的手势感知模型。我们还研究了肌肉间的同步和肌肉连接互联的图网络作为手部神经解码器。我们的模型利用高效的时频特征和时间序列分析技术，在分类性能方面实现了突显的提升。通过在多个手势识别任务上的实验验证，我们的模型相对现有方法显示出更优越的性能。",
