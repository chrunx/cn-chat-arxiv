    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2408.00874v1 公告类型：新增 摘要：在这篇论文中，我们介绍了医学 SAM 2（MedSAM-2），这是一个高级的分割模型，它利用 SAM 2框架来解决二维和三维医学图像分割任务。通过采用将医学图像视为视频的哲学，MedSAM-2不仅适用于三维医学图像，而且解锁了新的“一次性提示”分割能力。这允许用户只为一个或特定图像的目标对象提供一个提示，之后模型可以独立地在所有后续图像中自动分割相同的对象，而不考虑图像之间的时序关系。我们在多种医学成像模式中评估了 MedSAM-2，包括腹部器官、视网膜、脑肿瘤、甲状腺结节和皮肤病变，将其与现有技术在传统和互动分割设置中对齐。我们的发现表明，MedSAM-2不仅在性能上超过了现有模型，而且表现出在无需用户触发的情况下对单一目标对象进行多帧图像分割的能力。",
