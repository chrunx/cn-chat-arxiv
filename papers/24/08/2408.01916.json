    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.01916v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Process models are frequently used in software engineering to describe business requirements, guide software testing and control system improvement. However, traditional process modeling methods often require the participation of numerous experts, which is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, the exploration of a more efficient and cost-effective automated modeling method has emerged as a focal point in current research. This article explores a framework for automatically generating process models with multi-agent orchestration (MAO), aiming to enhance the efficiency of process modeling and offer valuable insights for domain experts. Our framework MAO leverages large language models as the cornerstone for multi-agent, employing an innovative prompt strategy to ensure efficient collaboration among multi-agent.
