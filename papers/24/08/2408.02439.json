    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2408.02439v1 公告类型：交叉  摘要：自然语言处理（NLP）领域的最新进展促进了大型语言模型（LLM）的发展，这些模型能够解决大量的任务。它们应用的关键方面之一是它们能够处理长文本文档和处理长序列的标记。这创造了对长情境理解评估的需求。为了满足俄罗斯语言的需求，我们提出了一项长输入基准（LIBRA），它包括21个适应化的数据集，以深入研究LLM对长文本的理解。测试被分为四个复杂度组，并允许在各种上下文长度上评估模型，上下文长度从4k直到128k个标记。我们为LIBRA提供了开源数据集、代码库和公共排行榜，以指引未来的研究。",
