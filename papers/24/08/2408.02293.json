    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.02293v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent research has seen notable progress in the development of linkage-based artificial hands. While previous designs have focused on adaptive grasping, dexterity and biomimetic artificial skin, only a few systems have proposed a lightweight, accessible solution integrating tactile sensing with a compliant linkage-based mechanism. This paper introduces OPENGRASP LITE, an open-source, highly integrated, tactile, and lightweight artificial hand. Leveraging compliant linkage systems and MEMS barometer-based tactile sensing, it offers versatile grasping capabilities with six degrees of actuation. By providing tactile sensors and enabling soft grasping, it serves as an accessible platform for further research in tactile artificial hands.",
