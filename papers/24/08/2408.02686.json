    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.02686v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized biomedical research by providing sophisticated methods to handle complex, high-dimensional data. Multimodal deep learning (MDL) further enhances this capability by integrating diverse data types such as imaging, textual data, and genetic information, leading to more robust and accurate predictive models. In MDL, differently from early and late fusion methods, intermediate fusion stands out for its ability to effectively combine modality-specific features during the learning process. This systematic review aims to comprehensively analyze and formalize current intermediate fusion methods in biomedical applications. We investigate the techniques employed, the challenges faced, and potential future directions for advancing intermediate fusion methods. Additionally, we introduce a structured notation to enhance the understanding and application of these methods beyond the biomedical domain. Our findings are ",
