In this paper, we propose a domain penalisation (DP) framework for the task of object detection, where the data is assumed to be sampled from multiple source domains and tested on completely unseen test domains. We assign penalisation weights to each domain, with the values updated based on the detection networks performance on the respective source domains. By prioritising the domains that needs more attention, our approach effectively balances the training process. We evaluate our solution on the GWHD 2021 dataset, a component of the W",

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种名为“Domain Penalisation”的框架，用于改善对象检测的跨域泛化能力。框架通过为多个源域数据分配惩罚权重，并根据检测网络在不同源域上的性能更新这些权重，从而在训练过程中有效平衡并优先考虑需要更多关注的域。这种方法有望提高模型在未知目标域上的鲁棒性能。"
