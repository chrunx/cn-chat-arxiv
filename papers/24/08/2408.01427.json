This ability is attributed to their capacity to focus on details and identify common features between previously seen and new images. In contrast, existing few-shot image classification methods often emphasize either global features or local features, with few studies considering the integration of both. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach based on the Siamese Transformer Network (STN). Our method employs two parallel branch networks utilizing the pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to extract global and local features, respectively.
