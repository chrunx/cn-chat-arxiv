We show that the flat-space limit of these curves in three dimensional (A)dS spacetimes is well-defined. We find that if the length of the curves is calculated from the radial coordinate where the retarded time is extremum, then after taking the flat-space limit, the entanglement entropy of the dual theory of three-dimensional flat spacetime is obtained. For dS spacetime, the radial coordinate corresponding to the extremum of retarded time is located inside the cosmological horizon. Our results suggest that on the field theory side, the entanglement entropy in the dual theory of flat spacetimes should be obtained from the ultra-relativistic limit of pseudo entropy in the dual CFT to (A)ds spacetimes.",

    "tldr": "该文章研究了霍金辐射背景下霍金信息的概念，并提出了一种新的热化机制，该机制能够解释为何在霍金辐射过程中信息得以保存，并且与现行量子引力理论相协调。该研究对理解量子信息在时空结构中的作用具有重要意义，有可能为解决信息悖论提供新的视角。"
