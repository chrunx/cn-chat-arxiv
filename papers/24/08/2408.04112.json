However, making sense of many generated elements can be overwhelming. Moreover, if the user wants to precisely control aspects of generated elements that are difficult to specify verbally, prompting alone may be insufficient. We introduce Patchview, a customizable LLM-powered system that visually aids worldbuilding by allowing users to interact with story concepts and elements through the physical metaphor of magnets and dust. Elements in Patchview are visually dragged closer to concepts with high relevance, facilitating sensemaking. The user can also steer the generation with verbally elusive concepts by indicating the desired position of the element between concepts. When the user disagrees with the LLM's visualization and generation, they can correct those by repositioning the element. These cor",
