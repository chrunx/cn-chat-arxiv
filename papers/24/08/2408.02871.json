In this work, we introduce a novel black-box approach for fingerprinting LLMs, achieving an impressive 72% accuracy in identifying the correct family of models (Such as Llama, Mistral, Gemma, etc) among a lineup of LLMs. We present an evolutionary strategy that leverages the capabilities of one LLM to discover the most salient features for identifying other LLMs. Our method employs a unique \"Hide and Seek\" algorithm, where an Auditor LLM generates discriminative prompts, and a Detective LLM analyzes the responses to fingerprint the target models.
