We then describe the construction of a modular tensor category (MTC) associated to rational LLCFTs. We explicitly construct the modular data and braiding and fusing matrices for the MTC. As a concrete example, we show that the LLCFT based on a certain even, self-dual Lorentzian lattice of signature $(m,n)$ with $m$ even realises the $D(m\\bmod 8)$ level 1 Kac-Moody MTC.",
