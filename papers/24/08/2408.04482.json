However, there are certain challenges that hinder the deployment of AI models \"in-the-wild\" scenarios, i.e., inefficient use of unlabeled data, lack of incorporation of human expertise, and lack of interpretation of the results. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel Explainable Active Learning (XAL) model, XAL-based semantic segmentation model \"SegXAL\", that can (i) effectively utilize the unlabeled data, (ii) facilitate the \"Human-in-the-loop\" paradigm, and (iii) augment the model decisions in an interpretable way. In particular, we investigate the application of the SegXAL model for semantic segmentation in driving scene scenarios.
