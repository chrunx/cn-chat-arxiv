    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.02709v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: This study analyzes hybrid AI systems' design patterns and their effectiveness in clinical decision-making using the boxology framework. It categorizes and copares various architectures combining machine learning and rule-based reasoning to provide insights into their structural foundations and healthcare applications. Addressing two main questions, how to categorize these systems againts established design patterns and how to extract insights through comparative analysis, the study uses design patterns from software engineering to understand and optimize healthcare AI systems. Boxology helps identify commonalities and create reusable solutions, enhancing these systems' scalability, reliability, and performance. Five primary architectures are examined: REML, MLRB, RBML, RMLT, and PERML. Each has unique strengths and weaknesses, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in clinical tasks. REML excels in high-accuracy prediction for ",
