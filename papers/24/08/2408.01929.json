    "translated_abstract": "乳腺癌是全球范围内重要的健康挑战，需要精确的诊断和有效的治疗策略，其中组织病理学对Hematoxylin和Eosin（H&E）染色的组织切片起了核心作用。尽管它的作用非常重要，但是评估像表皮生长因子受体2（HER2）这样的特定生物标记以实现个性化的治疗仍然受到资源密集型的免疫组织化学（IHC）的限制。深度学习最近的一些进展，特别是在图像到图像翻译方面，为从H&E染色切片合成IHC-HER2切片提供了希望。然而，现有的方法遇到了一些挑战，包括处理病理图像的多倍率和在翻译过程中对重要信息的不足关注。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个结合注意力机制和多倍率信息处理的新模型。我们的模型使用了一种",
