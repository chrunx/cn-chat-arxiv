    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.01527v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: This study explores the use of several LLMs for providing quantitative zero-shot sentiment analysis of implicit software desirability expressed by users. The study provides scaled numerical sentiment analysis unlike other methods that simply classify sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative. Numerical analysis provides deeper insights into the magnitude of sentiment, to drive better decisions regarding product desirability.   Data is collected through the use of the Microsoft Product Desirability Toolkit (PDT), a well-known qualitative user experience analysis tool. For initial exploration, the PDT metric was given to users of ZORQ, a gamification system used in undergraduate computer science education. The PDT data collected was fed through several LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3 and 3.5, GPT4, and GPT4o) and through a leading transfer learning technique, Twitter-Roberta-Base-Sentiment (TRBS), and through Vader, a leading sentiment analysis ",
