    "tldr": "该文章系统探索了四维$\\mathcal{N}=1$超级对称场理论（SCFTs）的相图，这些理论是通过将相关变形和自由 chiral multiplets 的耦合引入到具有少量物质多极的 supersymmetric gauge 理论中来稳定化的。文章中，作者识别出了 7,346 个等价的固定点 SCFT，这些固定点是通过非平凡的稳定性检验得到的。这些固定点展现出了有趣的几率特征，包括动量常数（a）与 central charges（c）呈窄分布、与重子数相关以及轻子动力学与 $a/c$ 比值的相关性。这些固定点的 $a/c$ 比例在0.7228和1.2100之间，这表明文章中的 SCFTs 比之前已知的非共线性 SCFTs 具有更大的相互作用强度。"
