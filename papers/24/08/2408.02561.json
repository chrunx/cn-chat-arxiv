The predicted boxes with high classification scores but poor localization positions or low classification scores but accurate localization positions will worsen the performance of detectors after Non-Maximum Suppression. Furthermore, when object detectors collaborate with Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), we observe that the task inharmony problem will be further exacerbated, which is considered one of the main causes of the performance degradation of quantized detectors. To tackle this issue, we propose the Harmonious Quantization for Object Detection (HQOD) framework, which consists of two components. Firstly, we propose a task-correlated loss to encourage detectors to focus on improving samples with lower task harmony quality during QAT. Secondly, a harmonious Intersection over Union (IoU) ",
