In this work, we first present a comprehensive benchmarking of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) across 11 medical image modalities and videos and point out its strengths and weaknesses by comparing it to SAM1 and MedSAM. Then, we develop a transfer learning pipeline and demonstrate SAM2 can be quickly adapted to medical domain by fine-tuning. Furthermore, we implement SAM2 as a 3D slicer plugin and Gradio API for efficient 3D image and video segmentation. The code has been made publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/bowang-lab/MedSAM}.",
