Advanced SOD methods often utilize various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Transformers for deep feature extraction. However, these methods still deliver low performance and poor generalization in complex cases. Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) has been proposed as a visual fundamental model, which gives strong segmentation and generalization capabilities. Nonetheless, SAM requires accurate prompts of target objects, which are unavailable in SOD. Additionally, SAM lacks the utilization of multi-scale and multi-level information, as well as the incorporation of fine-grained details. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Multi-scale and Detail-enhanced SAM (MDSAM) for SOD.
