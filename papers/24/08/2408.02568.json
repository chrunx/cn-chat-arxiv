An often overlooked issue is the cost of the labeling process, which is typically high due to the need for a significant investment in time and money associated with human experts. Existing semi-supervised learning methods often focus on operating in the feature space created by the fusion of available modalities, neglecting the potential for cross-utilizing complementary information available in each modality. To address this problem, we propose Cross-Modality Clustering-based Self-Labeling (CMCSL). Based on a small set of pre-labeled data, CMCSL groups instances belonging to each modality in the deep feature space and then propagates known labels within the resulting clusters. Next",
