    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.02912v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Online Imitation Learning methods struggle with the gap between extensive online exploration space and limited expert trajectories, which hinder efficient exploration due to inaccurate task-aware reward estimation. Inspired by the findings from cognitive neuroscience that task decomposition could facilitate cognitive processing for efficient learning, we hypothesize that an agent could estimate precise task-aware imitation rewards for efficient online exploration by decomposing the target task into the objectives of \"what to do\" and the mechanisms of \"how to do\". In this work, we introduce the hybrid Key-state guided Online Imitation (KOI) learning approach, which leverages the integration of semantic and motion key states as guidance for task-aware reward estimation. Initially, we utilize the visual-language models to segment the expert trajectory into semantic key states, indicating the objectives of \"what to do\". Within the intervals ",
