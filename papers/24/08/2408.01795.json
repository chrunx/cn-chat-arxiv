As an important support to promote the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry, cloud service optimization has received the attention of researchers. In recent years, remarkable research results have been achieved in this field. For the sustainability of intelligent manufacturing platforms, in this paper we summarize the process of cloud service optimization for intelligent manufacturing. Further, to address the problems of dispersed optimization indicators and nonuniform/unstandardized definitions in the existing research, 11 optimization indicators that take into account three-party participant subjects are defined from the urgent requirements of the sustainable development of intelligent manufacturing platform",
