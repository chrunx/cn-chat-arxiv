However, most existing techniques are limited to controlled indoor environments and difficult to capture the rice panicle traits under natural growth conditions. Here, we developed PanicleNeRF, a novel method that enables high-precision and low-cost reconstruction of rice panicle three-dimensional (3D) models in the field using smartphone. The proposed method combined the large model Segment Anything Model (SAM) and the small model You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) to achieve high-precision segmentation of rice panicle images. The NeRF technique was then employed for 3D reconstruction using the images with 2D segmentation. Finally, the resulting point clouds are processed to successfully extract panicle traits.
