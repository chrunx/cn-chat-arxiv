Early approaches primarily focus on learning entity embeddings from the structural features of KGs, defined by relation triples. Later methods incorporated entities' names and attributes as auxiliary information to enhance embeddings for EA. However, these approaches often used different techniques to encode structural and attribute information, limiting their interaction and mutual enhancement.
