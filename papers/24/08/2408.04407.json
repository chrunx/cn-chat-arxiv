Propagation models including clutter information have been shown to significantly increase model accuracy. This paper explores the application of deep learning to satellite imagery to identify environmental clutter types automatically. Recognizing these clutter types has numerous uses, but our main application is to use clutter information to enhance propagation prediction models. Knowing the type of obstruction (tree, building, and further classifications) can improve the prediction accuracy of key propagation metrics such as path loss.",
