    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.02798v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: We propose a framework for analyzing discourse by combining two interdependent concepts from sociolinguistic theory: face acts and politeness. While politeness has robust existing tools and data, face acts are less resourced. We introduce a new corpus created by annotating Wikipedia talk pages with face acts and we use this to train a face act tagger. We then employ our framework to study how face and politeness interact with gender and power in discussions between Wikipedia editors. Among other findings, we observe that female Wikipedians are not only more polite, which is consistent with prior studies, but that this difference corresponds with significantly more language directed at humbling aspects of their own face. Interestingly, the distinction nearly vanishes once limiting to editors with administrative power.",

    "tldr": "该文章创新性地提出了结合社会语言学理论中的“面子行为（face acts）”和“礼貌”（politeness）分析论域的框架，并利用Wikipedia talk页面的新文本资源来训练face act标签器。文章通过分析性别和权力在Wikipedia编辑之间的讨论中，发现女性编辑在语言上更加礼貌，并且在自我谦逊方面的话语更多。同时，当仅考虑有权力的编辑时，这种性别差异几乎消失。"
