While the giant graviton indices may be written as suitable contour integrals, care must be taken in their evaluation, as there can be an ambiguity in choice of integration contour or, equivalently, \"pole selection\". We resolve this ambiguity by using Murthy's recent expansion of the superconformal index to provide a rigorous underpinning of the evaluation of the supergravity giant graviton indices. In doing so, we directly relate Murthy's giant graviton expansion to the supergravity D3-brane expansion.",
