    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种从草图重建可控纹理和详细3D面孔的新方法，名为S2TD-Face。S2TD-Face引入了一种两阶段的几何重建框架，可以直接从输入草图中重建详细的几何结构。为了保持几何结构与草图精细笔触的一致性，我们提出了一种新的草图至几何损失，即 \\textbf{descriptive text}，用以指导网络在几何重建过程中的笔触控制。此外，为了保留草图中纹理的丰富性，S2TD-Face还设计了一个从草图纹理生成3D空间内纹理映射的方法，使得重建的3D面孔既具有细节丰富的几何结构，也覆盖了纹理细节。通过实验验证，S2TD-Face可以应用于多种场景，如动画制作、3D虚拟形象创建、艺术设计、失踪人员搜索等。",
