In this study, we propose a novel deep residual 3D attention non-local network (NL-RAN) to classify CT images included COVID-19, common pneumonia, and normal to perform rapid and explainable COVID-19 diagnosis. We built a deep residual 3D attention non-local network that could achieve end-to-end training. The network is embedded with a nonlocal module to capture global information, while a 3D attention module is embedded to focus on the details of the lesion so that it can directly analyze the 3D lung CT and output the classification results. The output of the attention module can be used as a heat map to increase the interpretability of the model. 4079 3D CT scans were included in this study. Each scan had a unique label (novel coronavirus pneumonia, common pneumonia, and normal). The CT scans cohort was randomly split into a training set of 3263",

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种名为NL-RAN的3D注意力非局部网络，用于快速且可解释地诊断COVID-19。通过对CT图像进行直接分析并输出分类结果，该网络能够捕获全局信息和关注病变细节，增加模型的解释性。该网络在包含4079个来自不同分类的3D CT扫描的训练集中进行验证，展示了其在新型冠状病毒感染、普通肺炎和正常肺部CT图像分类方面的有效性。"
