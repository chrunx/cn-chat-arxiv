    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.02192v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper addresses two vital challenges in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) with a focus on harnessing the power of Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models. Firstly, UDA has primarily relied on ImageNet pre-trained models. However, the potential of VLP models in UDA remains largely unexplored. The rich representation of VLP models holds significant promise for enhancing UDA tasks. To address this, we propose a novel method called Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (CMKD), leveraging VLP models as teacher models to guide the learning process in the target domain, resulting in state-of-the-art performance. Secondly, current UDA paradigms involve training separate models for each task, leading to significant storage overhead and impractical model deployment as the number of transfer tasks grows. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Residual Sparse Training (RST) exploiting the benefits conferred by VLP's extensive pre-training, ",
