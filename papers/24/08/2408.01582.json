Individual treatment effect offers the most granular measure of treatment effect on an individual level, and is the most useful to facilitate personalized care.

In this article, we propose a novel conformal diffusion model-based approach that addresses those intricate challenges. We integrate the highly flexible diffusion modeling, the model-free statistical inference paradigm of conformal inference, along with propensity score and covariate local approximation that tackle distributional shifts.
