We first present an updated version of a traditional argument that limitative results from computability and complexity theory show that proof discovery is an inherently difficult problem. We then illustrate how several recent applications of artificial intelligence-inspired methods -- respectively involving automated theorem proving, SAT-solvers, and large language models -- do indeed raise novel questions about the nature of mathematical proof. We also argue that the results obtained by such techniques do not tell against our basic argument. This is so because they are embodiments of brute force search and are thus capable of deciding only statements of low logical complexity.",
