However, these scholarly writings are often laden with jargon and tailored for domain experts rather than the general public. As librarians, we strive to offer services to a diverse audience, including those with lower reading levels. To extend our services beyond mere access, we propose fine-tuning a language model to rewrite scholarly abstracts into more comprehensible versions, thereby making scholarly literature more accessible when requested. We began by introducing a corpus specifically designed for training models to simplify scholarly abstracts. This corpus consists of over three thousand pairs of abstracts and significance statements from diverse disciplines. We then fine-tuned four language models using this corpus. The outputs from the models were subsequently examined both quantitatively for accessibilit",
