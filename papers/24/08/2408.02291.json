This paper presents, \"SelfGeo\", a self-supervised method that computes persistent 3D keypoints of non-rigid objects from arbitrary PCDs without the need of human annotations. The gist of SelfGeo is to estimate keypoints between frames that respect invariant properties of deforming bodies.

    "tldr": "该文章描述了一种名为SelfGeo的自我监督方法，该方法无需人类注释即可从任意点云数据中估计非刚性物体3D keypoints，并确保这些关键点能随着物体的形态变化保持语义和几何上的一致性。主要贡献在于实现关键点与其他点之间的不变性几何距离，这对于非刚性物体中关键点的稳定估计至关重要。"
