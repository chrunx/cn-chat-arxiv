In standard FSL, models are evaluated on query instances sampled from the same class distribution of the support set. In this work, we explore the more nuanced and practical challenge of Open-Set Few-Shot Recognition (OSFSL). Unlike standard FSL, OSFSL incorporates unknown classes into the query set, thereby requiring the model not only to classify known classes but also to identify outliers. Building on the groundwork laid by previous studies, we define a novel transductive inference technique that leverages the InfoMax principle to exploit the unlabelled query set.
