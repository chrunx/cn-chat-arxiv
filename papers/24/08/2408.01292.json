    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.01292v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Panoramic X-ray (PX) is a prevalent modality in dental practice for its wide availability and low cost. However, as a 2D projection image, PX does not contain 3D anatomical information, and therefore has limited use in dental applications that can benefit from 3D information, e.g., tooth angular misa-lignment detection and classification. Reconstructing 3D structures directly from 2D PX has recently been explored to address limitations with existing methods primarily reliant on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for direct 2D-to-3D mapping. These methods, however, are unable to correctly infer depth-axis spatial information. In addition, they are limited by the in-trinsic locality of convolution operations, as the convolution kernels only capture the information of immediate neighborhood pixels. In this study, we propose a progressive hybrid Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-CNN pyra-mid network (3DPX) for 2D-to-3D oral PX reconstruction. ",
