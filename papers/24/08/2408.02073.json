Based on the number of newborns in Huaibei, Anhui Province, China, in 2023 (94,420), it is estimated that there are about 7,500 cases (suspected cases of developmental delays) of suspicious cases annually. Early identification and appropriate early intervention for these children can significantly reduce the wastage of medical resources and societal costs. International research indicates that the optimal period for intervention in children with developmental delays is before the age of six, with the golden treatment period being before three and a half years of age. Studies have shown that children with developmental delays who receive early intervention exhibit significant improvement in symptoms; some may even fully recover. This research adopts a hybrid model combining a CNN-Tran",
