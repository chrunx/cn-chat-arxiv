Although many deep learning solutions for nuclei instance segmentation and classification exist in the literature, they often entail high computational costs and resource requirements, thus limiting their practical usage in medical applications. To address this issue, we introduce a novel convolutional neural network, NuLite, a U-Net-like architecture designed explicitly on Fast-ViT, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight CNN. We obtained three versions of our model, NuLite-S, NuLite-M, and NuLite-H, trained on the PanNuke dataset. The experimental results prove that our models equal CellViT (SOTA) in terms of panoptic quality and detection. However, our lightest model, NuLite-S, is 40 times smaller in terms of parameters and about 8 times smaller in terms of GFlops, while our heaviest model is 17 ti",
