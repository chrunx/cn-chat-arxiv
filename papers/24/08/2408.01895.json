A dichromat's color perception is a reduced two-dimensional (2D) subset of a normal trichromat's three dimensional color (3D) perception, leading to confusion when visual stimuli that appear identical to the dichromat are referred to by different color names. Using our proposed system, CVD individuals can interactively induce distinct perceptual changes to originally confusing colors via a computational color space transformation. By combining their original 2D precepts for colors with the discriminative changes, a three dimensional color space is reconstructed, where the dichromat can learn to resolve color name confusions and accurately recognize colors. Our system is implemented as an Augmented Reality (AR) interface on smartphones, where users interactively control the rotation through swipe gestures and observe ",
