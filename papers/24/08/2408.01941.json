    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.01941v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the advanced field of bio-inspired robotics, the emergence of cyborgs represents the successful integration of engineering and biological systems. Building on previous research that showed how electrical stimuli could initiate and speed up a jellyfish's movement, this study presents a groundbreaking approach that explores how the natural embodied intelligence of the animal can be harnessed to address pivotal challenges such as spontaneous exploration, navigation in various environments, control of whole-body motion, and real-time predictions of behavior. We have developed a comprehensive data acquisition system and a unique setup for stimulating jellyfish, allowing for a detailed study of their movements. Through careful analysis of both spontaneous behaviors and behaviors induced by targeted stimulation, we have identified subtle differences between natural and induced motion patterns.
