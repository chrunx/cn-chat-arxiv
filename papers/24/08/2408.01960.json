Additionally, mainstream methods require training bespoke models for different objects, which incurs heavy costs and lacks flexibility in practice. To address these issues, we seek help from Stable Diffusion (SD) model due to its capability of zero/few-shot inpainting, which can be leveraged to inpaint anomalous regions as normal.
