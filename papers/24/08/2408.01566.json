However, these methods are only accurate within a range of head angles; exceeding this specific range led to significant inaccuracies. This is dominantly explained by unclear specificity of the coordinate systems and Euler Angles used in the foundational rotation matrix calculations. Here, we addressed these limitations by presenting (1) methods that accurately infer the correct coordinate system and Euler angles in the correct axis-sequence, (2) novel formulae for 2D geometric augmentations of the rotation matrices under the (SPECIFIC) coordinate system, (3) derivations for the correct drawing routines for rotation matrices and poses, and (4) mathematical experimentation and verification that allow proper pitch-yaw coverage for full-range head po",
