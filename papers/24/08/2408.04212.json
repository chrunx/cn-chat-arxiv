    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.04212v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrated impressive performance in zero-shot promptable segmentation on natural images. The recently released Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) model claims to have better performance than SAM on images while extending the model's capabilities to video segmentation. It is important to evaluate the recent model's ability in medical image segmentation in a zero-shot promptable manner. In this work, we performed extensive studies with multiple datasets from different imaging modalities to compare the performance between SAM and SAM 2. We used two point prompt strategies: (i) single positive prompt near the centroid of the target structure and (ii) additional positive prompts placed randomly within the target structure. The evaluation included 21 unique organ-modality combinations including abdominal structures, cardiac structures, and fetal head images acquired from publicly available MRI, CT, and Ultrasoun",
