    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.03178v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce a new approach for generating realistic 3D models with UV maps through a representation termed \"Object Images.\" This approach encapsulates surface geometry, appearance, and patch structures within a 64x64 pixel image, effectively converting complex 3D shapes into a more manageable 2D format. By doing so, we address the challenges of both geometric and semantic irregularity inherent in polygonal meshes. This method allows us to use image generation models, such as Diffusion Transformers, directly for 3D shape generation. Evaluated on the ABO dataset, our generated shapes with patch structures achieve point cloud FID comparable to recent 3D generative models, while naturally supporting PBR material generation.",

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种将3D模型简化为64x64像素图像的新方法，以生成带有UV映射的逼真3D形状。通过这种方式，复杂的三维形状被转换成更易处理的二维结构，从而解决了网格形状的几何和语义非一致性问题。该方法允许使用图像生成模型直接生成3D形状，并在ABO数据集上获得了与最近3D生成模型相似的点云FID性能。"
