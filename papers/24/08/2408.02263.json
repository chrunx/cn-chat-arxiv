    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2408.02263v1 公告类型：新  翻译摘要：当前基于激光雷达的3D单对象跟踪（SOT）方法通常依赖于基于点的表示网络。尽管这些网络已经展示出了成功，但它们确实存在一些根本问题：1）它包含池化操作以应对固有的无序点云，这阻碍了捕获对于跟踪，即预测任务有用的3D空间信息。2）采用的集合抽象操作很难处理密度不一致的点云，这也阻止了对3D空间信息的建模。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了一种新的跟踪框架，称为VoxelTrack。通过将固有无序的点云体元化并使用稀疏卷积块提取其特征，VoxelTrack有效地对3D空间信息进行了建模，从而引导了对跟踪对象精确位置的预测。此外，VoxelTrack结合了一个双流编码器，该编码器具有跨层特征融合的能力，并且采用了高维长的最短路径优化算法来进一步增强端到端训练的效率。通过实验验证，VoxelTrack在几种流行的3D SOT基准测试数据集上超过了现有的点云跟踪方法。",
