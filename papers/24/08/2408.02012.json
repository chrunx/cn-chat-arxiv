In Iran, the financial repercussions of road traffic accidents represent approximately 2% of the nation's Gross National Product each year. Bleeding is the leading cause of mortality in trauma patients within the first 24 hours following an injury, making rapid diagnosis and assessment of severity crucial. Trauma patients require comprehensive scans of all organs, generating a large volume of data. Evaluating CT images for the entire body is time-consuming and requires significant expertise, underscoring the need for efficient time management in diagnosis. Efficient diagnostic processes can significantly reduce treatment costs and decrease the likelihood of secondary complications.
