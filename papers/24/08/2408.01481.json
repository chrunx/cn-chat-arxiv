    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.01481v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Assessing artistic creativity has long challenged researchers, with traditional methods proving time-consuming. Recent studies have applied machine learning to evaluate creativity in drawings, but not paintings. Our research addresses this gap by developing a CNN model to automatically assess the creativity of students' paintings. Using a dataset of 600 paintings by professionals and children, our model achieved 90% accuracy and faster evaluation times than human raters. This approach demonstrates the potential of machine learning in advancing artistic creativity assessment, offering a more efficient alternative to traditional methods.",
