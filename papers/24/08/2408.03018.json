Correspondingly, researchers must address the challenge of integrating multiple diverse motion skills into controllers. While existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have achieved notable success in multi-skill integration for legged robots, these methods often require intricate reward engineering or are restricted to integrating a predefined set of motion skills constrained by specific task objectives, resulting in limited flexibility. In this work, we introduce a flexible multi-skill integration framework named Controllable Skills Integration (CSI). CSI enables the integration of a diverse set of motion skills with varying styles into a single policy without the need for complex reward tuning. Furthermore, in a hierarchical control manner, the trained low-level policy can be coupled with a high-level Natural Language Inference (N",
