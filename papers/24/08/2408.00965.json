    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2408.00965v1 公告类型：新  摘要：人工智能（AI）技术在各个行业部门中得到了广泛的发展和应用。将环境、社会和治理（ESG）考虑因素与AI投资相结合，对于确保伦理和技术上的可持续发展至关重要。特别是从投资者的角度来看，这种整合不仅能够减轻风险，还能够通过与更广泛的全球目标保持一致，从而提升长期的价值创造。然而，学术界和工业界对这个领域的探讨相对较少。为了弥补这一差距，我们提出了一个全新的ESG-AI框架，这个框架是基于与28家公司合作经验中的洞察而开发的。该框架由三个关键组成部分组成。通过与业界实践者的合作，我们为这一整合提供了一个结构化的方法。ESG-AI框架概述了人工智能应用的环境和社会影响，帮助使用者，如投资者，去评估和管理AI投资的价值，同时推动公司的可持续性目标和盈利能力的发展。此外，我们设计了一个在线评估工具，以确保该框架的实用性和可扩展性。",
