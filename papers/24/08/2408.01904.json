Thus far, this need has been met via the recommended inclusion of a note, with little to no guidance on what the note itself should include. This has been identified as a problem to the use of AI in academic and research contexts. This article introduces The Artificial Intelligence Disclosure (AID) Framework, a standard, comprehensive, and detailed framework meant to inform the development and writing of GenAI disclosure for education and research.",
