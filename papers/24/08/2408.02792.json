In this work, we look at another clinically useful feature, skin lesion elevation, and investigate the feasibility of predicting and leveraging skin lesion elevation labels. Specifically, we use a deep learning model to predict image-level lesion elevation labels from 2D skin lesion images. We test the elevation prediction accuracy on the derm7pt dataset, and use the elevation prediction model to estimate elevation labels for images from five other datasets: ISIC 2016, 2017, and 2018 Challenge datasets, MSK, and DermoFit. We evaluate cross-domain generalization by using these estimated elevation labels as auxiliary inputs t",
