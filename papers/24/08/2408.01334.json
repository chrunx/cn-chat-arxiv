To address these challenges, we propose a novel Therblig-based Backbone Framework (TBBF) to enhance robot task understanding and transferability. This framework uses therbligs (basic action elements) as the backbone to decompose high-level robot tasks into elemental robot configurations, which are then integrated with current foundation models to improve task understanding. The approach consists of two stages: offline training and online testing. During the offline training stage, we developed the Meta-RGate SynerFusion (MGSF) network for accurate therblig segmentation across various tasks. In the online testing stage, after a one-shot demonstration of a new task is collected, our MGSF network extracts high-level knowledge, which is then encoded into the image using Action Registration (ActionREG).

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2408.01334v1 公告类型: 新  翻译摘要: 端到端机器人学习，特别是在长期任务领域，常常导致不可预测的结果和不良的泛化。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种基于Therblig的框架，即TBBF (Therblig-based Backbone Framework)，来提高机器人任务理解的能力和转移性。该框架将高级机器人任务分解为基本机器人配置，使用therbligs（基本动作元素）作为支撑，并与当前的基础模型相结合，以提高任务理解的效果。该方法包括两个阶段：离线训练和在线测试。在离线训练阶段，我们开发了Meta-RGate SynerFusion (MGSF)网络来准确地分割各种任务的therbligs。在线测试阶段，在收集一个新的任务演示之后，我们的MGSF网络提取高阶知识，并通过ActionREG（动作注册）将其编码成图像。此外，我们还开发了一种有效的Meta-Learner，它可以从单个任务的表现中提取知识并泛化到不同任务中，从而提高了模型的泛化能力。这种综合方法通过在多个复杂的实际任务中进行验证，展示了提升机器人任务理解性能的有效性。",
