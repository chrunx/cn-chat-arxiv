    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.01334v2 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: End-to-end robot learning, particularly for long-horizon tasks, often results in unpredictable outcomes and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Therblig-based Backbone Framework (TBBF) to enhance robot task understanding and transferability. This framework uses therbligs (basic action elements) as the backbone to decompose high-level robot tasks into elemental robot configurations, which are then integrated with current foundation models to improve task understanding. The approach consists of two stages: offline training and online testing. During the offline training stage, we developed the Meta-RGate SynerFusion (MGSF) network for accurate therblig segmentation across various tasks. In the online testing stage, after a one-shot demonstration of a new task is collected, our MGSF network extracts high-level knowledge, which is then encoded into the image using Action Registration (ActionREG).

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种基于Therblig的Backbone Framework（TBBF），通过将高阶机器人任务分解为基本动作元素（therbligs），并结合当前的基础模型，提高了机器人对任务的理解能力和泛化能力。这种框架通过两个阶段来实现：首先通过Meta-RGate SynerFusion（MGSF）网络在离线训练阶段进行准确的动作元素分割，然后在使用新任务演示后，通过ActionREG方法将高阶知识编码到图像中，从而在线上测试阶段实现任务的理解。"
