    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2408.01018v1 公告类型: 交叉 摘要: 分子性质预测和药物设计中有效的分子表征学习至关重要。然而，现有的方法在标注不足和架构设计不佳方面存在局限性。例如，图神经网络（GNNs）由于过度压缩而导致分子结构的重要细节丢失，从而影响了分子表征。在此工作中，我们提出了一种新的GNN类，即GNN-MolKAN及其增强变种GNN-MolKAN+，它们将人工智能+科学领域的Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KAN）架构融入GNNs，以解决这些挑战。此外，我们引入了自适应快速KAN（AdFastKAN），这是一种高级KAN，提供了增加的稳定性和速度，进一步提升了标准GNN的性能。值得注意的是，我们的方法具有三个关键优势：1) 卓越性能：GNN-MolKAN和GNN-MolKAN+展示了优越的预测能力，具有强大的泛化能力；2) 结构掌握：KAN结合了GNN的结构动态感知能力；3) 高效学习：AdFastKAN实现了快的训练过程和稳定的预测精度。通过实验验证，我们证明GNN-MolKAN和GNN-MolKAN+在多样化分子特性预测任务上表现出了优越的性能，表明了KAN框架在GNNs中的有效性。",
