    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.04249v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present InstantStyleGaussian, an innovative 3D style transfer method based on the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene representation. By inputting a target style image, it quickly generates new 3D GS scenes. Our approach operates on pre-reconstructed GS scenes, combining diffusion models with an improved iterative dataset update strategy. It utilizes diffusion models to generate target style images, adds these new images to the training dataset, and uses this dataset to iteratively update and optimize the GS scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method ensures high-quality stylized scenes while offering significant advantages in style transfer speed and consistency.",
