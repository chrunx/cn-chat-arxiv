    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.04515v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Identifying the regions of a learning resource that a learner pays attention to is crucial for assessing the material's impact and improving its design and related support systems. Saliency detection in videos addresses the automatic recognition of attention-drawing regions in single frames. In educational settings, the recognition of pertinent regions in a video's visual stream can enhance content accessibility and information retrieval tasks such as video segmentation, navigation, and summarization. Such advancements can pave the way for the development of advanced AI-assisted technologies that support learning with greater efficacy. However, this task becomes particularly challenging for educational videos due to the combination of unique characteristics such as text, voice, illustrations, animations, and more. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no study that evaluates saliency detection approaches in educational videos.",
