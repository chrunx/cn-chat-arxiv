    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.01075v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents both opportunities and challenges for English for Academic Purposes (EAP) instruction. This paper proposes an adaptation of the AI Assessment Scale (AIAS) specifically tailored for EAP contexts, termed the EAP-AIAS.   This framework aims to provide a structured approach for integrating GenAI tools into EAP assessment practices while maintaining academic integrity and supporting language development. The EAP-AIAS consists of five levels, ranging from \"No AI\" to \"Full AI\", each delineating appropriate GenAI usage in EAP tasks. We discuss the rationale behind this adaptation, considering the unique needs of language learners and the dual focus of EAP on language proficiency and academic acculturation.   This paper explores potential applications of the EAP-AIAS across various EAP assessment types, including writing tasks, presentations, and research projects. By ",
