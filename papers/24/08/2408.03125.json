    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.03125v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: As the NLP community increasingly addresses challenges associated with multilingualism, robust annotation tools are essential to handle multilingual datasets efficiently. In this paper, we introduce a code-mixed multilingual text annotation framework, COMMENTATOR, specifically designed for annotating code-mixed text. The tool demonstrates its effectiveness in token-level and sentence-level language annotation tasks for Hinglish text. We perform robust qualitative human-based evaluations to showcase COMMENTATOR led to 5x faster annotations than the best baseline. Our code is publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/lingo-iitgn/commentator}. The demonstration video is available at \\url{https://bit.ly/commentator_video}.",

    "tldr": "该文章介绍了一个名为COMMENTATOR的代码混合型多语言文本标注框架，该框架专为确保有效地标注代码混合型文本而设计。通过展示在Hinglish文本的词汇级别和句子级别的语言标注任务中达到与现有最佳方法相比五倍的标注效率，COMMENTATOR证明了自己的有效性。此外，相关代码已公开，可在GitHub上的https://github.com/lingo-iitgn/commentator页面获取，并在https://bit.ly/commentator_video播放了一个演示视频。"
