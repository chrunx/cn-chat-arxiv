    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2408.01269v1 公告类型：新  翻译摘要：文本到3D内容创建最近受到很大关注，尤其是在3D Gaussians Splatting普及的情况下。一般来说，基于GS的方法包括两个关键阶段：初始化和渲染优化。为了达到初始化，现有的工作直接应用随机球体初始化或者3D扩散模型，比如Point-E，来获取初始形状。然而，这样的策略存在着两个根本性的挑战：1）即使经过训练，最终形状仍然与初始形状相似；2）对于简单文本，如“一只狗”，形状可以被产生，但对于词汇丰富的文本，如“一只狗坐在飞机的顶部”，则不能。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种新的通用框架，利用词汇丰富性提高文本到3D生成的3D GS初始化。我们的关键想法是将3D Gaussians聚集到空间均匀的voxels中来表示复杂的形状，同时确保了复杂形状的表达能力，并为更丰富描述的语言提供了详细的3D表示。",
