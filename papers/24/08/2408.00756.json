In this paper, we extensively evaluate SAM 2's ability to segment both 2D and 3D medical images by first collecting 18 medical imaging datasets, including common 3D modalities such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) as well as 2D modalities such as X-ray and ultrasound.
