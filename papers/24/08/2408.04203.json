    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.04203v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recently, Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) have garnered increasing attention for their potential to deliver emotional value and facilitate sociological research. However, existing studies are primarily confined to the textual modality, unable to simulate humans' multimodal perceptual capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of Multimodal Role-Playing Agents (MRPAs), and propose a comprehensive framework, MMRole, for their development and evaluation, which comprises a personalized multimodal dataset and a robust evaluation method. Specifically, we construct a large-scale, high-quality dataset, MMRole-Data, consisting of 85 characters, 11K images, and 14K single or multi-turn dialogues. Additionally, we present a robust evaluation method, MMRole-Eval, encompassing eight metrics across three dimensions, where a reward model is trained to score MRPAs with the constructed ground-truth data for comparison. Moreover, we develop the",
