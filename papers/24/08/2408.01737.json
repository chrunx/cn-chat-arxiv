Several approaches in the literature have utilized architectural plans in this regard.

To address this issue, we present a novel localization and mapping method denoted as deviations-informed Situational Graphs or diS-Graphs that integrates prior knowledge from architectural plans even in the presence of deviations. It is based on Situational Graphs (S-Graphs) that merge geometric models of the environment with 3D scene graphs into a multi-layered jointly optimizable factor graph.
