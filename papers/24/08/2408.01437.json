CAD models are precise, programmatic constructs that involves sequential operations combining discrete command structure with continuous attributes -- making it challenging to learn and optimize in an end-to-end fashion. Concurrently, input images introduce inherent challenges such as photo-metric variability and sensor noise, complicating the reverse engineering process. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that conditionally factorizes the task into two sub-problems.
