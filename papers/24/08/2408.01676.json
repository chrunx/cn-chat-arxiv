The manuscript presents the fault-tolerant techniques and mechanical designs to achieve a fault-tolerant multirotor, and a vision-based navigation system required to achieve a precision landing. Preliminary experimental results will be shown, to validate on one hand the fault-tolerant control vehicle and, on the other hand, the autonomous landing algorithm. Also, a prototype of the fault-tolerant UAV is presented, capable of precise autonomous landing, which will be used in future experiments.",
