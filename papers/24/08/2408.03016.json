    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.03016v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: The Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) spacetime possesses a naked singularity, although it represents an exact particle-like solution to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory with a massless scalar field. Here, we investigate the possible formation of a naked singularity in the JNW spacetime, using the thin-shell approximation to describe the gravitational collapse. By introducing different matter contents to construct thin-shells, we demonstrate the impossibility of naked singularity formation during the gravitational collapse unless the causality or null energy condition of the thin-shell is violated. Therefore, the weak cosmic censorship is satisfied even with the naked singularity of the JNW spacetime.",

    "tldr": "该文章创新性地探讨了JNW时空中的裸 singularity 形成可能性，并研究了通过引入不同的物质内容构建的质膜在描述引力坍缩过程中对裸 singularity 形成的限制，从而确定了在满足因果律和非零能量条件的情况下，即使原始JNW时空包含裸 singularity，引力坍塌过程中也不发生裸 singularity。"
