    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.03923v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents an approach to decomposing animated graphics into sprites, a set of basic elements or layers. Our approach builds on the optimization of sprite parameters to fit the raster video. For efficiency, we assume static textures for sprites to reduce the search space while preventing artifacts using a texture prior model. To further speed up the optimization, we introduce the initialization of the sprite parameters utilizing a pre-trained video object segmentation model and user input of single frame annotations. For our study, we construct the Crello Animation dataset from an online design service and define quantitative metrics to measure the quality of the extracted sprites. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms baselines for similar decomposition tasks in terms of the quality/efficiency tradeoff.",

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种高效的方法，用于将动画图像分解为基本的元素或层，称为“精灵”。该方法利用优化后的精灵参数与矢量视频匹配，并通过假设精灵纹理静态来缩小搜索空间，同时通过纹理先验模型防止过时现象。为加速优化过程，该文还介绍了一种利用预训练视频对象分割模型初始化精灵参数的方法，并设计了一个从用户单帧标注中获取初始值的系统。通过构建自一个在线设计服务的“Crello动画”数据集以及定义定量评价标准来评估提取精灵的质量。实验结果表明，与类似分解任务的标准方法相比，该方法在质量和效率之间取得了显著的优势。"
