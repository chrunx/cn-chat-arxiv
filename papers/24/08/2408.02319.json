    "title": "Self-centering 3-DOF feet controller for hands-free locomotion control in telepresence and virtual reality",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.02319v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a novel seated foot controller for handling 3-DOF aimed to control locomotion for telepresence robotics and virtual reality environments. Tilting the feet on two axes yields in forward, backward and sideways motion. In addition, a separate rotary joint allows for rotation around the vertical axis. Attached springs on all joints self-center the controller. The HTC Vive tracker is used to translate the trackers' orientation into locomotion commands. The proposed self-centering foot controller was used successfully for the ANA Avatar XPRIZE competition, where a naive operator traversed the robot through a longer distance, surpassing obstacles while solving various interaction and manipulation tasks in between. We publicly provide the models of the mostly 3D-printed feet controller for reproduction.",

    "tldr": "该文章介绍了用于远程呈现和虚拟现实环境中无手操作的3自由度脚踏控制器，其中脚踏通过两个轴向倾斜实现向前、向后和侧向移动，并允许围绕垂直轴旋转。控制器使用自调整机制保持初始位置，而HTC Vive追踪器被用来将追踪器的方向转换为运动命令。通过在著名的ANA Avatar XPRIZE竞赛中的成功实战，该脚踏控制器显示出其对于非专业操作员的操作便利性和在穿越障碍物、解决交互和操作任务时的有效性。作者还提供了大部分由3D打印制造的脚踏控制器的模型，以供复制研究。"
