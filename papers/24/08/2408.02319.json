    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.02319v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present a novel seated foot controller for handling 3-DOF aimed to control locomotion for telepresence robotics and virtual reality environments. Tilting the feet on two axes yields in forward, backward and sideways motion. In addition, a separate rotary joint allows for rotation around the vertical axis. Attached springs on all joints self-center the controller. The HTC Vive tracker is used to translate the trackers' orientation into locomotion commands. The proposed self-centering foot controller was used successfully for the ANA Avatar XPRIZE competition, where a naive operator traversed the robot through a longer distance, surpassing obstacles while solving various interaction and manipulation tasks in between. We publicly provide the models of the mostly 3D-printed feet controller for reproduction.",

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2408.02319v1 公告类型: 新公布 摘要: 本文提出了一种新型的座位式脚控制器，用于控制远程呈现机器人和虚拟现实环境中的移动。在两个轴上的倾斜脚产生前进、后退和侧向运动。此外，一个单独的回旋关节允许围绕垂直轴旋转。所有关节上都安装了弹簧，以实现自动中心化的控制器。使用HTC Vive跟踪器来将跟踪器的方向转换成移动命令。我们提出的自适应脚控制器在ANAvatar XPRIZE竞赛中得到了成功使用，在这个竞赛中，一个无知的操作员在通过障碍物的同时解决各种交互和操作任务时，使机器人通过更远的距离。我们公开提供了大部分3D打印的脚控制器模型，以供复制。",
