Most existing methods focus on adopting a cropping strategy to improve the ability of multimodal large language models to understand image details. However, this cropping operation inevitably causes the segmentation of objects and connected areas, which impairs the MLLM's ability to recognize small or irregularly shaped objects or text. This issue is particularly evident in lightweight MLLMs. Addressing this issue, we propose Mini-Monkey, a lightweight MLLM that incorporates a plug-and-play method called multi-scale adaptive crop strategy (MSAC).

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种名为Mini-Monkey的轻量级多模态语言模型，通过多尺度自适应裁剪策略（MSAC）解决了现有方法在处理高分辨率图像时对物体分割的问题。MSAC能够从不同尺度中选择非分割的物体，而Scale Compression Mechanism（SCM）则有效减少了MSAC引入的计算 overhead，提升了模型对小物体或非规则形状物体的识别能力。"
