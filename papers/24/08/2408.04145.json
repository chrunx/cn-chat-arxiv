    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.04145v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in integrating semantic information between images and text through contrastive learning techniques. It has achieved remarkable performance in various multimodal tasks. However, the deployment of large CLIP models is hindered in resource-limited environments, while smaller models frequently fall short of meeting performance benchmarks necessary for practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, coined as ComKD-CLIP: Comprehensive Knowledge Distillation for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-traning Model, which aims to comprehensively distill the knowledge from a large teacher CLIP model into a smaller student model, ensuring comparable performance with significantly reduced parameters. ComKD-CLIP is composed of two key mechanisms: Image Feature Alignment (IFAlign) and Educational Attention (EduAttention). IFAlign makes the image features extracted by the student mode",
