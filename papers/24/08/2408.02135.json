    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.02135v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Considering digital ink as plane curves provides a valuable framework for various applications, including signature verification, note-taking, and mathematical handwriting recognition. These plane curves can be obtained as parameterized pairs of approximating truncated series (x(s), y(s)) determined by sampled points. Earlier work has found that representing these truncated series (polynomials) in a Legendre or Legendre-Sobolev basis has a number of desirable properties. These include compact data representation, meaningful clustering of like symbols in the vector space of polynomial coefficients, linear separability of classes in this space, and highly efficient calculation of variation between curves. In this work, we take a first step at examining the use of Chebyshev-Sobolev series for symbol recognition. The early indication is that this representation may be superior to Legendre-Sobolev representation for some purposes.",
