However, the possibility of identifying deceased individuals based on their iris patterns has emerged recently as a supplementary or alternative method valuable in forensic analysis. Simultaneously, it poses numerous new technological challenges and one of the most challenging among them is the image segmentation stage as conventional iris recognition approaches have struggled to reliably execute it. This paper presents and compares Deep Learning (DL) models designed for segmenting iris images collected from the deceased subjects, by training SegNet and DeepLabV3+ semantic segmentation methods where using VGG19, ResNet18, ResNet50, MobileNetv2, Xception, or InceptionResNetv2 as backbones.
