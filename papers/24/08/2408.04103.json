This study introduces a novel approach to visual sentiment analysis by integrating attitudinal differences into visual sentiment classification. Recognizing that societal divides, such as partisan differences, heavily influence sentiment labeling, we developed a dataset that reflects these divides.

Applied to immigration-related images, our approach captures perspectives from both Democrats and Republicans.

    "tldr": "该文章创新性地提出了将意识形态分歧纳入视觉情感分析框架的方法，通过整合不同政党的视觉情感差异，训练了一个多任务多类深度学习模型，以预测从多个政治观点出发的图像情感。这种方法有效地捕捉了移民相关图像在不同政党观点下的情感反应，并通过将多样性观点纳入标注和模型训练过程中，解决了标签模糊的问题，并提高了视觉情感预测的准确性。"
