    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.01576v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Laboratory automation is an expensive and complicated endeavor with limited inflexible options for small-scale labs. We develop a prototype system for tending to a bench-top centrifuge using computer vision methods for color detection and circular Hough Transforms to detect and localize centrifuge buckets. Initial results show that the prototype is capable of automating the usage of regular bench-top lab equipment.",
