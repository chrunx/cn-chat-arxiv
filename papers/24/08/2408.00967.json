We discuss how to get heights and the future of LiDAR and imagery processing. SOTA object segmentation allows us to take get object heights with no deep learning background. Engineers will be keeping track of world data across generations and reprocessing them. They will be using older procedural methods like this paper and newer ones discussed here. SOTA methods are going beyond analysis and into generative AI. We cover both a procedural methodology and the newer ones performed with language models. These include point cloud, imagery and text encoding allowing for spatially aware AI.",
