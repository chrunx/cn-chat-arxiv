HSI may enable precise differentiation between various tissue types and pathologies, making it particularly valuable for tumour detection, tissue classification, and disease diagnosis.   Deep learning-based segmentation methods have shown considerable advancements, offering automated and accurate results. However, these methods face challenges with HSI datasets due to limited annotated data and discrepancies from hardware and acquisition techniques~\\cite{clancy2020surgical,studier2023heiporspectral}. Variability in clinical protocols also leads to different definitions of structure boundaries. Interactive segmentation methods, utilizing user knowledge and clinical insights, can overcome these issues and achieve precise segmentation results \\ci",
