    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.02766v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this work, we introduce a deep-learning framework designed for estimating dense image correspondences. Our fully convolutional model generates dense feature maps for images, where each pixel is associated with a descriptor that can be matched across multiple images. Unlike previous methods, our model is trained on synthetic data that includes significant distortions, such as perspective changes, illumination variations, shadows, and specular highlights. Utilizing contrastive learning, our feature maps achieve greater invariance to these distortions, enabling robust matching. Notably, our method eliminates the need for a keypoint detector, setting it apart from many existing image-matching techniques.",

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一个名为ConDL的深学习框架，用于估计稠密图像对应关系，通过在全卷积模型中生成图像的稠密特征图，每个像素都被赋予了能够跨多张图像匹配的描述符。与以往的方法不同，该模型在包含各种扭曲的合成数据上进行了训练，包括视角变化、光照差异、阴影和反光亮点等。该文章使用对比学习来增强特征图对这些扭曲的鲁棒性，从而实现匹配结果的稳固性。此外，该方法的独特之处在于它不需要关键点检测器，这显著区别于许多现有的图像匹配技术。"
