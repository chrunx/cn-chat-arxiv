Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning technique, have shown remarkable success in image processing. Because of their sophisticated architectures, advanced CNN-based models perform better in landslide detection than conventional algorithms. The purpose of this work is to investigate CNNs' potential in more detail, with an emphasis on comparison of CNN based models for better landslide detection. We compared four traditional semantic segmentation models (U-Net, LinkNet, PSPNet, and FPN) and utilized the ResNet50 backbone encoder to implement them.
