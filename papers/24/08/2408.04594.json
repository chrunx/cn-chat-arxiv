    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.04594v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: High-performance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely heavily on data quality. This study introduces a novel dataset named Img-Diff, designed to enhance fine-grained image recognition in MLLMs by leveraging insights from contrastive learning and image difference captioning. By analyzing object differences between similar images, we challenge models to identify both matching and distinct components. We utilize the Stable-Diffusion-XL model and advanced image editing techniques to create pairs of similar images that highlight object replacements. Our methodology includes a Difference Area Generator for object differences identifying, followed by a Difference Captions Generator for detailed difference descriptions. The result is a relatively small but high-quality dataset of \"object replacement\" samples. We use the the proposed dataset to fine-tune state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs such as MGM-7B, yielding comprehensive improvements of",
