Medical image segmentation is particularly complicated by inherent uncertainties. For instance, the ambiguous boundaries of tissues can lead to diverse but plausible annotations from different clinicians. These uncertainties cause significant discrepancies in clinical interpretations and impact subsequent medical interventions. Therefore, achieving quantitative segmentations from uncertain medical images becomes crucial in clinical practice. To address this, we propose a novel approach that integrates an \\textbf{uncertainty-aware model} with \\textbf{human-in-the-loop interaction}.
