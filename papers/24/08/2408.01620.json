    "translated_abstract": "虽然分割自然图像已经展示了令人印象深刻的性能，但这些技术不能直接应用于医疗图像分割。由于固有不确定性的存在，医疗图像分割尤其复杂。例如，组织边界的不明确性可能导致不同医生之间存在多样的但合理的标注。这些不确定性在临床解释上造成了显著差异，并影响了随后的医疗干预。因此，从具有不确定性的医疗图像中实现定量分割在临床实践中变得至关重要。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的方法，该方法结合了“不确定性感知模型”和“人类参与的循环”互动。不确定性感知模型提出了几种可能的分割以应对医疗图像固有的不确定性，而人类参与的循环互动则在临床实践中不断对分割结果进行迭代修改。",
