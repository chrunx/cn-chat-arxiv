Recent studies have proposed black-box adversarial attacks that require only the final transcription from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. However, these attacks typically involve many queries to the ASR, resulting in substantial costs. Moreover, AE-based adversarial audio samples are susceptible to ASR updates. In this paper, we identify the root cause of these limitations, namely the inability to construct AE attack samples directly around the decision boundary of deep learning (DL) models. Building on this observation, we propose ALIF, the first black-box adversarial linguistic feature-based attack pipeline. We leverage the reciprocal process of text-to-speech (TTS) and ASR models to generate perturbations in the linguistic embedding space where the decision boundary resides. Based on the ALIF pi",
