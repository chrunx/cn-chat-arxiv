Accurately detecting AD, especially in the early stage, represents a high research priority. AD is characterized by progressive cognitive impairments that are related to alterations in brain functional connectivity (FC). Based on this association, many studies have been published over the decades using FC and machine learning to differentiate AD from healthy aging. The most recent development in this detection method highlights the use of graph neural network (GNN) as the brain functionality analysis. In this paper, we proposed a stack of spatio-temporal feature extraction and graph generation based AD classification model using resting state fMRI.
