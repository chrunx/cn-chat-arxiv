    "title": "No Size Fits All: The Perils and Pitfalls of Leveraging LLMs Vary with Company Size",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.01444v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are playing a pivotal role in deploying strategic use cases across a range of organizations, from large pan-continental companies to emerging startups. The issues and challenges involved in the successful utilization of LLMs can vary significantly depending on the size of the organization. It is important to study and discuss these pertinent issues of LLM adaptation with a focus on the scale of the industrial concerns and brainstorm possible solutions and prospective directions. Such a study has not been prominently featured in the current research literature. In this study, we adopt a threefold strategy: first, we conduct a case study with industry practitioners to formulate the key research questions; second, we examine existing industrial publications to address these questions; and finally, we provide a practical guide for industries to utilize LLMs more efficiently.",
