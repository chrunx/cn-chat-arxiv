    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.02226v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we propose ProCreate, a simple and easy-to-implement method to improve sample diversity and creativity of diffusion-based image generative models and to prevent training data reproduction. ProCreate operates on a set of reference images and actively propels the generated image embedding away from the reference embeddings during the generation process. We propose FSCG-8 (Few-Shot Creative Generation 8), a few-shot creative generation dataset on eight different categories -- encompassing different concepts, styles, and settings -- in which ProCreate achieves the highest sample diversity and fidelity. Furthermore, we show that ProCreate is effective at preventing replicating training data in a large-scale evaluation using training text prompts. Code and FSCG-8 are available at https://github.com/Agentic-Learning-AI-Lab/procreate-diffusion-public. The project page is available at https://procreate-diffusion.github.io.",

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种名为ProCreate的方法，该方法通过在生成过程中主动推动生成图像的嵌入远离参考图像嵌入，改进了扩散模型在图像生成方面的样本多样性与创造力，并有效防止了训练数据的重复生成。此外，该研究还创建了一个名为FSCG-8的少样本创造性生成数据集，包含八个不同类别，并在该数据集上验证了ProCreate的有效性。ProCreate的成功展示了其在防止文本提示驱动的大规模训练数据复制方面的潜力，并且相关的代码和数据集已在GitHub上发布。"
