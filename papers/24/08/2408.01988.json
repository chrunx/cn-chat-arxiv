However, the lifecycle of wearable systems faces several challenges. First, effective model training for new wearable devices requires substantial labeled data from various subjects collected directly by the wearable. Second, subsequent model updates require further extensive labeled data for retraining. Finally, frequent model updating on the wearable device can decrease the battery life in long-term data monitoring. Addressing these challenges, in this paper, we propose MetaWearS, a meta-learning method to reduce the amount of initial data collection required.
