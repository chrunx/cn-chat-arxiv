Once trained, the method is evaluated in a classical way using state-of-the-art iris PAD benchmarks. We designed two generative models for the synthesis of ISO/IEC 19794-6-compliant iris images. The first model synthesizes bona fide-looking samples. To avoid ``identity leakage,'' the generated samples that accidentally matched those used in the model's training were excluded. The second model synthesizes images of irises with textured contact lenses and is conditioned by a given contact lens brand to have better control over textured contact lens appearance when forming the training set.
