The approach aims to quantify and compare the contributions of different state dimensions to various action choices. To more accurately analyze these impacts, we introduce new characteristic value functions, the ``Counterfactual Difference Characteristic Value\" and the ``Average Counterfactual Difference Characteristic Value.\" These functions help calculate the Shapley values to evaluate the differences in contributions between optimal and non-optimal actions. Experiments across several RL domains, such as GridWorld, FrozenLake, and Taxi, demonstrate the effectiveness of the CSV method. The results show that this method not only improves transparency in complex RL systems but also quantifies the differences across various decisions.",

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种名为Counterfactual Shapley Values的全新方法，旨在增强强化学习（RL）的透明度，通过结合反事实分析与Shapley值来量化和比较不同状态维度对不同动作选择的影响。通过引入新的特征值函数，如“反事实差异特征值”和“平均反事实差异特征值”，该研究解决了分析这些影响时的难题，并计算了Shapley值以评估最优动作和非最优动作之间的贡献差异。通过在GridWorld、FrozenLake和Taxi等多个RL领域内的实验，证明了CSV方法的有效性。实验结果表明，该方法不仅提高了复杂RL系统中的透明度，还量化了不同决策间的差异。"
