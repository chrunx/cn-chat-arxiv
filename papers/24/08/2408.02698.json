    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种名为DeepNetBeam的框架，用于使用不同类型的SciML（科学机器学习）方法分析具有功能 gradients的孔隙状 beams。该框架通过连续函数模型材料的属性来应对不规则配置，并比较三种不同方法下的输出：PINN（Physics-Informed Neural Network）基于向量方法，DEM（Deep Energy Method）基于能量方法，以及基于神经操作器的数据驱动方法。三种方法均基于连续形式，以网络输出作为位移场的近似，并推导了支配beams行为的方程。实验结果表明，使用神经操作器的预测在处理功能梯度材料下的孔隙beams响应时，对任意的 porosity分布和梯度特性都表现出了高效的预测性能。"
