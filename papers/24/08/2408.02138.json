    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在视觉社区中吸引近期兴趣的行动质量评估(AQA)问题。不幸的是，以前的方法往往忽视了人类专家使用的评分大纲，并且未能量化模型的预测不确定性。为了弥合这一差距，我们提出了一种深层概率模型RICA^2，它整合了评分大纲，并对其预测不确定性进行了量化。我们的方法的核心在于动作步骤的随机嵌入，这些嵌入定义在一个编码评分大纲的图中。这些嵌入在潜在空间中分散概率密度，并且允许我们的方法表示模型不确定性。图编码了评分准则，基于这些准则，可以解码出质量分数。我们展示了我们的方法在包括FineDiving、MTL-AQA和JIGSAWS在内的公共基准测试中取得了新的记录，并且在预测性能上超过了现有技术。",
