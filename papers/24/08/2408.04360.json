    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.04360v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Road accidents are quite common in almost every part of the world, and, in majority, fatal accidents are attributed to over speeding of vehicles. The tendency to over speeding is usually tried to be controlled using check points at various parts of the road but not all traffic police have the device to check speed with existing speed estimating devices such as LIDAR based, or Radar based guns. The current project tries to address the issue of vehicle speed estimation with handheld devices such as mobile phones or wearable cameras with network connection to estimate the speed using deep learning frameworks.",
