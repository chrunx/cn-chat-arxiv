    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.03601v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Motion planning is a challenging task to generate safe and feasible trajectories in highly dynamic and complex environments, forming a core capability for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose DRAMA, the first Mamba-based end-to-end motion planner for autonomous vehicles. DRAMA fuses camera, LiDAR Bird's Eye View images in the feature space, as well as ego status information, to generate a series of future ego trajectories. Unlike traditional transformer-based methods with quadratic attention complexity for sequence length, DRAMA is able to achieve a less computationally intensive attention complexity, demonstrating potential to deal with increasingly complex scenarios. Leveraging our Mamba fusion module, DRAMA efficiently and effectively fuses the features of the camera and LiDAR modalities. In addition, we introduce a Mamba-Transformer decoder that enhances the overall planning performance. This module is universally adaptable",
