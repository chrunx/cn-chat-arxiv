Limitations of existing methods included variation in ECG waveforms due to the location of electrodes, high non-linearity in the signal, and amplitude measurement in millivolts. The present study reports a non-linear analysis-based methodology that utilizes Recurrence plot visualization. The patterned occurrence of well-defined structures, such as the QRS complex, can be exploited effectively using Recurrence plots. This Recurrence-based method is applied to the publicly available Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) dataset from PhysioNet database, where we studied four classes of different cardiac disorders (Myocardial infarction, Bundle branch blocks, Cardiomyopathy, and Dysrhythmia) and healthy controls, achieving an impressive classification accuracy of 100%.
