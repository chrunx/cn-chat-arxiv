To better represent 3D shapes, we introduce a volume encoding to explicitly encode the spatial information. We further design hierarchical volumes to encode the scene structures in multiple scales. The high-resolution volumes capture the high-frequency geometry details since spatially varying features could be learned from different 3D points, while the low-resolution volumes enforce the spatial consistency to keep the shape smooth since adjacent locations possess the same low-resolution feature. In addition, we adopt a sparse structure to reduce the memory consumption at high-resolution volumes, and two regularization terms to enhance results smoothness.
