    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2408.00925v1 公告类型：交叉  摘要：交叉提示注入攻击（XPIA）是一种有效的用于数据泄露的技术，近来在该领域得到了广泛的应用。在XPIA攻击中，攻击者能够在第三方数据中注入恶意指令，而这些数据很可能会被生成语言模型（LLM）在辅助用户时消费，用户成为受害者。XPIA通常被用作数据泄露的一种手段，估计一次平均数据泄露的成本对企业来说接近450万美元，这一成本包括了如企业凭证被篡改等不同类型的数据泄露。随着基于梯度的攻击，如GCG后缀攻击的兴起，使用GCG后缀的XPIA发生的概率令人担忧。在我作为Microsoft人工智能红队的工作中，我展示了在模拟的XPIA场景中使用GCG后缀配合注入漏洞的可行性攻击模型。结果表明，存在GCG后缀的情况下，成功数据泄露的概率几乎增加了20%，有些情况下甚至更高。然而，这种数据泄露的可能性并不意味着实际的成功率，因为除了技术因素外，还有管理和安全策略等非技术因素的影响。我们的研究旨在为数据保护提供新的视角和思考方向，同时也为防范此类攻击提供参考和建议。",
    "tldr": "本文揭示了一项新的数据泄露技术，即在利用生成语言模型协助时，通过注入恶意指令并使用GCG后缀提高数据泄露的成功率，尤其在企业环境中，这种攻击可能对业务造成约450万美元的损失。虽然存在风险，但通过管理和安全策略的改进，可以降低此类攻击的成功率。"
