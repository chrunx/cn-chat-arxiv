Specifically, we consider problems in which one must choose a subset of polymers to test in experiments such that the learning of the polymeric design rules is optimal. This subset must be selected from a larger set of polymers permissible under arbitrary experimental design constraints. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms by solving several pragmatic nucleic acid therapeutics engineering scenarios, where limitations in synthesis of chemically diverse nucleic acids or feasibility of measurements in experimental setups appear as constraints. Our approach focuses on identifying optimal experimental designs from a given set of experiments, which is in contrast to traditional, generative DoE methods like BIBD. Finally, we discuss how these algorithms are broadly applicable to well-established optimal DoE criteria like D-opti",
