Among the models evaluated, the YOLOv8m model, consisting of 25.9 million parameters and 79.1 GFLOPs, demonstrated a respectable balance between computational efficiency and detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.971 at 50% Intersection over Union (IoU) across both \"Fall Detected\" and \"Human in Motion\" categories. Although the YOLOv8l and YOLOv8x models presented higher precision and recall, particularly in fall detection, their higher computational demands and model size make them less suitable for resource-constrained environments.",
