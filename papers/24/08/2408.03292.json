In this work, we first propose a U-Net neural network model with attention gates which is specifically tailored to achieve fast and accurate image-based static IR drop prediction. Attention gates allow selective emphasis on relevant parts of the input data without supervision which is desired because of the often sparse nature of the IR drop map.
