In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs, specifically GPT-4 and LLaMA3, in detecting and explaining anomalies in time series. Our studies reveal that: 1) LLMs cannot be directly used for time series anomaly detection. 2) By designing prompt strategies such as in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting, GPT-4 can detect time series anomalies with results competitive to baseline methods. 3) We propose a synthesized dataset to automatically generate time series anomalies with corresponding explanations.

    "tldr": "该文章探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs），尤其是GPT-4和LLaMA3，在时间序列异常检测方面的潜力。研究表明，尽管LLMs不能直接用于时间序列异常检测，但通过特定的提示策略，如in-context learning和chain-of-thought prompting，GPT-4能够在检测时间序列异常方面与基准方法相媲美。此外，文章提出了一种自动生成时间序列异常和相关解释的合成数据集，并通过在数据集上进行指令微调，LLaMA3在某些指标上表现出了检测异常的能力。"
