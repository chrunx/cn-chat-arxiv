    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.02284v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Accurate alignment is crucial for video denoising. However, estimating alignment in noisy environments is challenging. This paper introduces a cascading refinement video denoising method that can refine alignment and restore images simultaneously. Better alignment enables restoration of more detailed information in each frame. Furthermore, better image quality leads to better alignment. This method has achieved SOTA performance by a large margin on the CRVD dataset. Simultaneously, aiming to deal with multi-level noise, an uncertainty map was created after each iteration. Because of this, redundant computation on the easily restored videos was avoided. By applying this method, the entire computation was reduced by 25% on average.",

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种级联精炼视频去噪方法，通过不确定性的自适应性来同时优化图像对齐和去噪过程，在CRVD数据集上实现了SOTA性能。该方法利用不确定性图来避免在噪声较轻的视频帧上进行不必要的计算，从而平均减少了25%的计算成本。"
