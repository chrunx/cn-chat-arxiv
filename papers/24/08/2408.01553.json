Compared to traditional SAR image processing methods, editing based on GAN latent space control is entirely unsupervised, allowing image processing to be conducted without any labeled data. Additionally, the information extracted from the data is more interpretable. This paper proposes a novel SAR image processing framework called GAN-based Unsupervised Editing (GUE), aiming to address the following two issues: (1) disentangling semantic directions in the GAN latent space and finding meaningful directions; (2) establishing a comprehensive SAR image processing framework while achieving multiple image processing functions.
