This paper presents a novel framework for contextual grounding in textual models, with a particular emphasis on the Context Representation stage. Our approach aims to enhance the reliability and ethical alignment of these models through a comprehensive, context-aware methodology. By explicitly capturing and representing relevant situational, cultural, and ethical contexts in a machine-readable format, we lay the foundation for anchoring a model's behavior within these contexts. Our approach leverages techniques from knowledge representation and reasoning, such as ontologies, semantic web technologies, and logic-based formalisms. We evaluate our framework on real-world textual datasets, demonstrating",

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种新的框架，通过一种全面的、情境化的方法来增强大型语言模型（LLM）的可靠性，并将其行为锚定在特定的情境、文化和伦理概念上。这种方法通过使用知识表示和推理技术如本体论、语义网技术和逻辑形式主义，将模型的行为与特定的情境、文化和伦理概念相结合，以提高模型的可靠性和与人类价值观的一致性。"
