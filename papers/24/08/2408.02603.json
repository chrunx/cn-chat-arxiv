Bayesian models are especially adept at this and are growing in use in ecology. Yet many ecologists today are not trained to take advantage of the bigger ecological data needed to generate more flexible robust models. Here we describe a broadly generalizable workflow for statistical analyses and show how it can enhance training in ecology. Building on the increasingly computational toolkit of many ecologists, this approach leverages simulation to integrate model building and testing for empirical data more fully with ecological theory.
