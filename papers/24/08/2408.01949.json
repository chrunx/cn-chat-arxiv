    "tldr": "The paper focuses on the efficient coding and computation in cortical circuits, connecting theoretical neuroscience with statistical physics. It discusses the mutual benefits of studying neural networks for understanding complex systems, nonequilibrium dynamics, and disordered systems in physics, and vice versa. The discussed work starts from the chaos in random neural networks and progresses to the efficient coding and the partial suppression of chaotic fluctuations. Key concepts from statistical physics, including phase transitions and critical phenomena, are highlighted for explaining the computational capabilities of neural networks."
