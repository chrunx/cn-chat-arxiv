However, as RFs become more widely used, the need for effective editing techniques that maintain coherence across different perspectives becomes evident. Current methods primarily depend on per-frame 2D image inpainting, which often fails to maintain consistency across views, thus compromising the realism of edited RF scenes. In this work, we introduce a novel RF editing pipeline that significantly enhances consistency by requiring the inpainting of only a single reference image. This image is then projected across multiple views using a depth-based approach, effectively reducing the inconsistencies observed with per-frame inpainting.

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种新的Radiance Fields编辑管线，它通过仅对单一参考图像执行内容填充，然后在深度信息基础上将其投影到多个视图中，从而在保持内容删除的一致性的同时显著减少视图中出现的歧义。此外，文章还考虑到了在真实世界场景中可能遇到的不一致性问题，通过适当的投影假设和处理，提高了编辑后场景的视觉一致性和真实性。"
