    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.03754v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Many application domains, e.g., in medicine and manufacturing, can greatly benefit from pneumatic Soft Robots (SRs). However, the accurate control of SRs has remained a significant challenge to date, mainly due to their nonlinear dynamics and viscoelastic material properties. Conventional control design methods often rely on either complex system modeling or time-intensive manual tuning, both of which require significant amounts of human expertise and thus limit their practicality. In recent works, the data-driven method, Automatic Neural ODE Control (ANODEC) has been successfully used to -- fully automatically and utilizing only input-output data -- design controllers for various nonlinear systems in silico, and without requiring prior model knowledge or extensive manual tuning. In this work, we successfully apply ANODEC to automatically learn to perform agile, non-repetitive reference tracking motion tasks in a real-world SR and within",
