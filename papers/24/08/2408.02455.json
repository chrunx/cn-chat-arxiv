    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.02455v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The problem of grasping objects using a multi-finger hand has received significant attention in recent years. However, it remains challenging to handle a large number of unfamiliar objects in real and cluttered environments. In this work, we propose a representation that can be effectively mapped to the multi-finger grasp space. Based on this representation, we develop a simple decision model that generates accurate grasp quality scores for different multi-finger grasp poses using only hundreds to thousands of training samples. We demonstrate that our representation performs well on a real robot and achieves a success rate of 78.64% after training with only 500 real-world grasp attempts and 87% with 4500 grasp attempts. Additionally, we achieve a success rate of 84.51% in a dynamic human-robot handover scenario using a multi-finger hand.",
