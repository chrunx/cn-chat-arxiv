    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.04528v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We are interested in automating reasoning with and about study regulations, catering to various stakeholders, ranging from administrators, over faculty, to students at different stages. Our work builds on an extensive analysis of various study programs at the University of Potsdam. The conceptualization of the underlying principles provides us with a formal account of study regulations. In particular, the formalization reveals the properties of admissible study plans. With these at end, we propose an encoding of study regulations in Answer Set Programming that produces corresponding study plans. Finally, we show how this approach can be extended to a generic user interface for exploring study plans.",
