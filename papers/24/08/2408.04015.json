Utilizing a diverse collection of image-to-LaTeX data, we build two models: a base model with a Swin Transformer encoder and a GPT-2 decoder, trained on machine-generated images, and a fine-tuned version enhanced with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) trained on handwritten formulas. We then compare the BLEU performance of our specialized model on a handwritten test set with other similar models, such as Pix2Text, TexTeller, and Sumen. Through this project, we contribute open-source models for converting images to LaTeX and provide from-scratch code for building these models with distributed training and GPU optimizations.",
