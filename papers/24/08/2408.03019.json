We compute these universal building blocks -- known as splitting amplitudes -- for two collinear QCD partons up to third loop order in QCD. Our results describe arbitrary time-like splitting processes. Due to the violation of strict collinear factorization in space-like splitting processes, we specifically present space-like splitting amplitudes for three-parton QCD scattering amplitudes at third loop order. To achieve our results, we perform a collinear expansion of three-loop scattering amplitudes using a new expansion-by-subgraph technology, which is based on the method of regions.",

    "tldr": "该文章计算了在QCD中，当费曼图中费曼节点无限接近时，理论分数量在最接近费曼节点的情况下，计算了三道循环圈和部分子结构的结果。这项工作为提供一个完整的，与具体过程无关的图节板和过程图数量的解释，为理解高能粒子的相互作用的复杂性提供了更深层次的理解。通过打破严格路径因子的局限性，该研究为理解高能粒子的相互作用复杂性提供了一种新工具，这将有助于未来我们对高能粒子相互作用的深入了解和计算。"
