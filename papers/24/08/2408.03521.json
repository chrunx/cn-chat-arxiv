Intuitively, most shadows come from the occlusion of light by the object itself, resulting in the object and its shadow being contiguous (referred to as the adjacent shadow in this paper). In this case, when the color of the object is similar to that of the shadow, existing methods struggle to achieve accurate detection. To address this problem, we present SwinShadow, a transformer-based architecture that fully utilizes the powerful shifted window mechanism for detecting adjacent shadows. The mechanism operates in two steps. Initially, it applies local self-attention within a single window, enabling the network to focus on local details.
