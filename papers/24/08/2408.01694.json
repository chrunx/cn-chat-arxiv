We introduce a Bayesian active learning framework based on sparse pixel-level annotation that utilizes a pixel-level Bayesian uncertainty measure based on Balanced Entropy (BalEnt) [84]. BalEnt captures the information between the models' predicted marginalized probability distribution and the pixel labels. BalEnt has linear scalability with a closed analytical form and can be calculated independently per pixel without relational computations with other pixels.

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种基于贝叶斯主动学习的方法，用于在稀疏像素级标注下训练语义分割模型。该方法利用了基于平衡熵（Balanced Entropy，BalEnt）的像素级贝叶斯不确定度度量，能够有效选择最具信息性的像素进行标注，从而以较小的标注成本实现与完全监督训练相当的性能。"
