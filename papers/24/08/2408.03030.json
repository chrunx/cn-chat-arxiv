This study addresses the issue of suboptimal single-spectral nighttime pedestrian detection performance under low-light conditions by incorporating background information into the channel attention mechanism. Despite numerous studies focusing on the development of efficient channel attention mechanisms, the relevance of background information has been largely disregarded. By adopting a contrast learning approach, we reexamine channel attention with regard to pedestrian objects and background information for nighttime pedestrian detection, resulting in the proposed Fore-Background Contrast Attention (FBCA).
