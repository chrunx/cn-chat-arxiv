    "translated_title": "实时灵巧遥操作方法：基于端效导向的机器学习 approach",
    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2408.00853v1 新闻类型：新 摘要：灵巧遥操作对于推动人类与机器人系统的进步至关重要，尤其是在需要精确和安全操作的任务中。然而，它面临着由于人类和机器人手之间的物理差异、与物体动态相互作用以及远程环境的间接控制和感知所带来的显著挑战。目前的方法主要集中在将人类手映射到机器人同伙上来复制运动，这在一定程度上犯了一个关键的错误：它经常忽视与物体的物理相互作用，并将交互负担完全转嫁给人类，要求其在间接和反直觉的远程环境的观察下作出劳作上的调整。本工作开发了一个基于端效导向的灵巧遥操作（EFOLD）框架，旨在解决遥操作任务。EFOLD将遥操作建模为马尔可夫博弈，引入了多个端效特征（end-effect features），同时考虑到人类手的动作和机器人手与物体的相互作用，以提高遥操作的效率和精确度。通过在多个复杂的遥操作任务中进行实验验证，结果表明EFOLD能够有效减少人类操作者的工作负载，同时提高交互效果的质量。这项研究为未来的远程操作框架提供了新的理论基础和实践指导。",
