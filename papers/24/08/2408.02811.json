    "abstract": "arXiv:2408.02811v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper presents and evaluates a new retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and large language model (LLM)-based artificial intelligence (AI) technique: rubric enabled generative artificial intelligence (REGAI). REGAI uses rubrics, which can be created manually or automatically by the system, to enhance the performance of LLMs for evaluation purposes. REGAI improves on the performance of both classical LLMs and RAG-based LLM techniques. This paper describes REGAI, presents data regarding its performance and discusses several possible application areas for the technology.",
