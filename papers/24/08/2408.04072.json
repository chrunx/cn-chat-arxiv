Therefore, understanding the composition and distribution of these datasets has become increasingly crucial. To address the need for intuitive exploration of these datasets, we propose AEye, an extensible and scalable visualization tool tailored to image datasets. AEye utilizes a contrastively trained model to embed images into semantically meaningful high-dimensional representations, facilitating data clustering and organization. To visualize the high-dimensional representations, we project them onto a two-dimensional plane and arrange images in layers so users can seamlessly navigate and explore them interactively. AEye facilitates semantic search functionalities for both text and image queries, enabling users to search for content. We open-s",
