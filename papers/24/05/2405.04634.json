Processing ALS data at scale requires efficient point classification methods that perform well over highly diverse territories. To evaluate them, researchers need large annotated Lidar datasets, however, current Lidar benchmark datasets have restricted scope and often cover a single urban area. To bridge this data gap, we present the FRench ALS Clouds from TArgeted Landscapes (FRACTAL) dataset: an ultra-large-scale aerial Lidar dataset made of 100,000 dense point clouds with high-quality labels for 7 semantic classes and spanning 250 km$^2$. FRACTAL is built upon France's nationwide open Lidar data. It achieves spatial and semantic diversity via a sampling scheme that explicitly concentrates rare classes and challenging landscapes from five French regions. It should support the development of 3D deep ",
