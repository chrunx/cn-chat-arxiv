It is a crucial companion to causal inference, necessary to build scientific knowledge without resorting to expensive or impossible randomised control trials. In this paper, we explore how reasoning with symbolic representations can support causal discovery. Specifically, we deploy assumption-based argumentation (ABA), a well-established and powerful knowledge representation formalism, in combination with causality theories, to learn graphs which reflect causal dependencies in the data. We prove that our method exhibits desirable properties, notably that, under natural conditions, it can retrieve ground-truth causal graphs. We also conduct experiments with an implementation of our method in answer set programming (ASP) on four datasets from standard benchmarks in causal discovery, showing that our method compares well against established baselines.",

    "tldr": "该文章利用基于假设的argumentation（ABA）和因果理论，以在数据中发现因果关系为研究对象。研究人员提出了一种方法，该方法能够从符号表示中支持因果发现，并通过证明该方法能够在某些自然条件下检索到真正的因果图，有效地证明了该方法的有效性。同时，文章通过在四种不同的因果发现基准数据集上，使用在Answer Set Programming（ASP）中实现的方法进行实验，与传统的方法进行了比较，证实了该方法在其他传统方法中的优越性。"
