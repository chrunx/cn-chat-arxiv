    "translated_abstract": "在过去十多年的时间里，深度学习模型已经在各种二维成像任务中占据了主导地位。现在，它们的应用范围正在扩展到三维成像领域，三维卷积神经网络（3D CNNs）能够处理LiDAR、MRI和CT扫描，这对自动驾驶和医疗成像等领域有着重大影响。在这些关键领域中，解释模型决策的基本原则极为重要。尽管在可解释的智能AI方面取得了最近的进展，但很少有人致力于解释3D CNN模型，而许多研究通过不充分的二维注意力方法的扩展来解释这些模型。",
    "tldr": "我们提出了SE3D框架，用于评估三维成像中的注意力方法，并针对3D CNN进行了基准测试和评价指标的改进。"
