Their application is now extending to 3D imaging, with 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) being able to process LIDAR, MRI, and CT scans, with significant implications for fields such as autonomous driving and medical imaging. In these critical settings, explaining the model's decisions is fundamental. Despite recent advances in Explainable Artificial Intelligence, however, little effort has been devoted to explaining 3D CNNs, and many works explain these models via inadequate extensions of 2D saliency methods.   A fundamental limitation to the development of 3D saliency methods is the lack of a benchmark to quantitatively assess these on 3D data. To address this issue, we propose SE3D: a framework for Saliency method Evaluation in 3D imaging. We propose modifications to ShapeNet, ScanNet, and BraTS datasets, and evaluation metrics ",
