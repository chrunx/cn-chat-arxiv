    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种名为SAM3D的新方法，它结合了现有的Segment Anything Model，用于在3D医学图像中实现半自动化的零样本分割。该方法通过用户在图像上绘制3D多边形来提示，并根据划分的体积进行切片，然后使用预训练模型对切片进行全量推理，最后在三维空间中进行重组和细化工作。该方法在多个成像模态和不同解剖结构上进行了评估。SAM3D在腹部盆腔CT和大脑MRI图像上的特定结构分割方面取得了显著的性能。最重要的是，该方法无需进行任何模型训练或微调，非常适用于数据标注不足的细分任务。通过允许用户快速生成对新数据的3D分割，SAM3D有望在手术规划和教育、诊断以及医学研究中发挥重要作用。"
