These monopoles have Standard Model quantum numbers, are stable, and we also require that their magnetic fluxes are consistent with the electroweak symmetry breaking. Scattering processes involving quarks, leptons and protons on these monopoles are studied using partial waves decomposition. These processes in the lowest partial wave are known to be unsuppressed by the monopole mass and are relevant for monopole catalysis of proton decay. We provide estimates for scattering cross-sections and investigate and confirm the applicability of the twisted sector approach to scattering processes on these Standard Model monopoles. We find that the SM monopole catalysis processes are universal and model-independent.",
