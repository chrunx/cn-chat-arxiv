This gives us more control over the generated images, allowing to generate them from a semantic segmentation map while not requiring such a segmentation in the training data. To this end we introduce the concept of tileable features, allowing us to identify activations that work well for painting.",

    "tldr": "该文章通过研究生成对抗网络（GANs）中的生成结构与其隐藏层激活之间的关联性，提出了一种新的方法来更好地理解和控制GANs的生成机制。研究人员通过引入可平铺特征的概念，能够在不需要训练数据中包含相关分割的情况下，基于语义分割图来生成图像。这种方法为GANs的实例化提供了一种新的途径，使得用户可以直接从语义分割图中获取逼真的图像，而不需要训练网络来识别这些分割图。"
