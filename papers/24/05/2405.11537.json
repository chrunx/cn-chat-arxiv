    "abstract": "arXiv:2405.11537v3 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: The advent of immersive Virtual Reality applications has transformed various domains, yet their integration with advanced artificial intelligence technologies like Visual Language Models remains underexplored. This study introduces a pioneering approach utilizing VLMs within VR environments to enhance user interaction and task efficiency. Leveraging the Unity engine and a custom-developed VLM, our system facilitates real-time, intuitive user interactions through natural language processing, without relying on visual text instructions. The incorporation of speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies allows for seamless communication between the user and the VLM, enabling the system to guide users through complex tasks effectively. Preliminary experimental results indicate that utilizing VLMs not only reduces task completion times but also improves user comfort and task engagement compared to traditional VR interaction methods.",
