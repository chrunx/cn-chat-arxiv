We developed a 3D MR fingerprinting (MRF) method for simultaneous T1 and T2 mapping across the whole mouse brain with 4.3-min temporal resolution. We designed a 3D MRF sequence with variable acquisition segment lengths and magnetization preparations on a 9.4T preclinical MRI scanner. Model-based reconstruction approaches were employed to improve the accuracy and speed of MRF acquisition. The method's accuracy for T1 and T2 measurements was validated in vitro, while its repeatability of T1 and T2 measurements was evaluated in vivo (n=3).
