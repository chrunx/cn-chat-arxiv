    "abstract": "arXiv:2405.15682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Existing learning rate schedules that do not require specification of the optimization stopping step T are greatly out-performed by learning rate schedules that depend on T. We propose an approach that avoids the need for this stopping time by eschewing the use of schedules entirely, while exhibiting state-of-the-art performance compared to schedules across a wide family of problems ranging from convex problems to large-scale deep learning problems. Our Schedule-Free approach introduces no additional hyper-parameters over standard optimizers with momentum. Our method is a direct consequence of a new theory we develop that unifies scheduling and iterate averaging. An open source implementation of our method is available (https://github.com/facebookresearch/schedule_free).",

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种新型策略，无需指定优化停止时间，通过摒弃学习率调度策略，在各种问题，包括凸问题和大型深度学习问题中，实现了与传统调度策略相当甚至超越的性能。同时，该方法不引入额外超参数，与带有 momentum 的标准优化器相同。该策略是新的理论成果的直接应用，该理论统一了调度和迭代平均化技术。该方法的开源实现已经公开https://github.com/facebookresearch/schedule_free。"
