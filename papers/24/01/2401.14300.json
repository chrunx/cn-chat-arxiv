    "title": "Amorphous silicon detectors for proton beam monitoring in FLASH radiotherapy",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2401.14300v2 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: Ultra-high dose rate radiation therapy (FLASH) based on proton irradiation is of major interest for cancer treatments but creates new challenges for dose monitoring. Amorphous hydrogenated silicon is known to be one of the most radiation-hard semiconductors. In this study, detectors based on this material are investigated at proton dose rates similar to or exceeding those required for FLASH therapy. Tested detectors comprise two different types of contacts, two different thicknesses deposited either on glass or on polyimide substrates. All detectors exhibit excellent linear behaviour as a function of dose rate up to a value of 20 kGy/s. Linearity is achieved independently of the depletion condition of the device and remarkably in passive (unbiased) conditions. The degradation of the performance as a function of the dose rate and its recovery are also discussed.",
