    "tldr": "该文章通过在loop quantum cosmology背景下对$\\alpha$-attractor模型的背景动力学进行研究，特别是分析了这些模型中的通货膨胀阶段的时间长度，以及紧随其后的量子跳跃。研究结果表明，可以从这些模型的预测中为参数$\\alpha$以及Barbero-Immirzi参数施加限制。此外，对宇宙学扰动的梯度和标量比的约束进一步限制了不同$\\alpha$吸引子模型（如T、E和$n=2$模型）中$\\alpha$的值，例如对于$n=0$、$n=1$和$n=2$的模型，其$\\alpha$值分别小于或等于10、17和67。这项研究对理解宇宙的早期宇宙学阶段和预测宇宙学的未来实验观察具有重要意义。"
