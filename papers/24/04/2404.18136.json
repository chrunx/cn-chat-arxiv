However, while these models excel at creating more realistic image content, they often leave noticeable traces of tampering, posing a significant threat to security. In this work, we take the anti-forensic capabilities into consideration, firstly proposing an end-to-end training framework for anti-forensic image inpainting named SafePaint. Specifically, we innovatively formulated image inpainting as two major tasks: semantically plausible content completion and region-wise optimization. The former is similar to current inpainting methods that aim to restore the missing regions of corrupted images. The latter, through domain adaptation, endeavors to reconcile the discrepancies between the inpainted region and the unaltered area to achieve a",
