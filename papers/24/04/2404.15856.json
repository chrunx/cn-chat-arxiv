It is demonstrated that for the finite renormalization of the gauge coupling constant its generators $\\hat L_n$ with $n\\ge 1$ satisfy the commutation relations of the Witt algebra and, therefore, form its subalgebra. The commutation relations are also written for the more general case when finite renormalizations are made for both the coupling constant and matter fields. We also construct the generator of the Abelian subgroup corresponding to the changes of the renormalization scale. The explicit expressions for the renormalization group generators are written in the case when they act on the $\\beta$-function and the anomalous dimension. It is explained how the finite changes of these functions under the finite renormalizations can be obtained with the help of the exponential map.",

    "tldr": "该文章提出将量子场论中的有限重标度群视为无限维Lie群，并证明了对于有限重标化下的 gauge耦合常数的生成元满足Witt代数的对易关系，从而形成其子代数。此外，文章还探讨了在耦合常数和基本费米子场的重标化下的更一般情况的对易关系。此外，文章还构建了对应于重标化尺度变化的阿贝尔子群的生成元，并给出了在β函数和异常维度下的生成元表达式。文章还解释了如何使用指数映射来得到在对易子的作用下β函数和异常维度下的有限变化。"
