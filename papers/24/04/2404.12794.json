Despite the promising results achieved by previous MOS methods, several key issues, such as the weak coupling of temporal and spatial information, still need further study. In this paper, we propose a novel LiDAR-based 3D Moving Object Segmentation with Motion-aware State Space Model, termed MambaMOS. Firstly, we develop a novel embedding module, the Time Clue Bootstrapping Embedding (TCBE), to enhance the coupling of temporal and spatial information in point clouds and alleviate the issue of overlooked temporal clues. Secondly, we introduce the Motion-aware State Space Model (MSSM) to endow the model with the capacity to understand the temporal correlations of the same object across different time steps.

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种名为MambaMOS的基于LiDAR的3D移动对象分割方法，该方法通过引入一个名为Time Clue Bootstrapping Embedding（TCBE）的新嵌入模块来增强点云中时空信息的耦合，并缓解了忽略时空线索的问题。同时，文章还引入了Motion-aware State Space Model（MSSM），以让模型能够理解不同时间步之间同一对象的空间状态，强调了移动对象的运动状态，从而在LiDAR点云数据中实现了更精确的移动对象分割。"
