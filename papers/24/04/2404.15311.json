    "abstract": "arXiv:2404.15311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: The task of Electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis is paramount to the development of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, to reach the goal of developing robust, useful BCIs depends heavily on the speed and the accuracy at which BCIs can understand neural dynamics. In response to that goal, this paper details the integration of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNet) to enhance the precision of EEG regression. The core of this approach lies in harnessing the sequential data processing strengths of ViTs along with the superior feature extraction capabilities of TCNet, to significantly improve EEG analysis accuracy. In addition, we analyze the importance of how to construct optimal patches for the attention mechanism to analyze, balancing both speed and accuracy tradeoffs. Our results showcase a substantial improvement in regression accuracy, as evidenced by the reduction of Root Me",
