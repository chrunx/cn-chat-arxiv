Those methods make the investigated models more interpretable for gradient-based saliency maps, computed in hidden layers. We evaluate the faithfulness of those methods using insertion and deletion metrics, finding that saliency maps computed in hidden layers perform better compared to both the input layer and GradCAM. We test our approach on different models trained for image classification on ImageNet1K, and models trained for tumor detection on Camelyon16 and in-house real-world digital pathology scans of stained tissue samples. Our results show that the checkerboard noise in the gradient gets reduced, resulting in smoother and therefore easier to interpret saliency maps.",
