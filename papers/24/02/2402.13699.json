Many of the measurements acquired during the tuning process come in the form of images that need to be properly analyzed to guide the subsequent tuning steps.

An important example of such images are so-called \\textit{triangle plots}, which visually represent current flow and reveal characteristics important for QD device calibration. While image-based classification tools, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be used to verify whether a given measurement is \\textit{good} and thus warrants the initiation of the next phase of tuning, they do not provide any insight",
