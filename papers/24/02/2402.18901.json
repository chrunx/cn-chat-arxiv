    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.18901v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: We systematically study the electromagnetic properties of controversial states whose internal structure is not elucidated and we try to offer a different point of view to unravel the internal structure of these states. Inspired by the $\\Omega_c$ states observed by the LHCb Collaboration, we study the electromagnetic properties of the $\\Omega_c$ states as the compact diquark-diquark-antiquark pentaquarks with both $J^P = \\frac{1}{2}^-$ and $J^P = \\frac{3}{2}^-$ in the context of the QCD light-cone sum rule model. From the obtained numerical results, we conclude that the magnetic dipole moments of the $\\Omega_c$ states can reflect their inner structures, which can be used to distinguish their spin-parity quantum numbers. Measuring the magnetic moment of the $\\Omega_c$ states in future experimental facilities can be very helpful for understanding the internal organization and identifying the quantum numbers of these states.",

    "tldr": "该文章通过利用光锥量子色动力学（QCD）方法，系统研究了争议性的Ωc0共振的基本电磁性质，试图通过这种方式探索这些未充分阐明的内部结构的实质。文章受到大型强子对撞机(LHCb)合作组观测到的Ωc0状态的启发，本文使用光锥求和规则模型研究了这些状态的电磁性质，这些状态被解释为具有两重子和三重子结构的紧凑的夸克-夸克-反夸克五夸克复合体，具有1/2-和3/2-的角动量- parity量子数。通过分析计算出的数值结果，文章得出结论，Ωc0状态的磁矩能够反映出它们的内部构造，而这种磁矩的测量极有可能在未来的实验设施中被用于区分这些状态的空间角动量- parity量子数，因此非常有利于理解它们的内部构成和辨别这些状态的量子数。"
