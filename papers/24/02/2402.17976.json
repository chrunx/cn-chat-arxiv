To address these issues, we propose an effective auxiliary pre-processing defense network, AADN, which performs defensive transformations on the input images before feeding them into the tracker. Moreover, it can be seamlessly integrated with other visual trackers as a plug-and-play module without parameter adjustments. We train AADN using adversarial training, specifically employing Dua-Loss to generate adversarial samples that simultaneously attack the classification and regression branches of the tracker.

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种有效的辅助对抗防御网络AADN，通过在输入图像进入Tracker之前执行防御性变换，增强图像跟踪对抗攻击的鲁棒性。AADN通过特定的DuAL-Loss训练生成同时攻击Tracker分类和回归分支的对抗样本，消除了图像上的不可察觉的扰动。经过在OTB100、LaSOT和VOT2018基准测试上的实验结果表明，AADN能够保持对对抗攻击的防御性同时不影响Tracker本身的性能。"
