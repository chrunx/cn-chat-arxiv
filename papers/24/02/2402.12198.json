    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.12198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Multimedia content on social media is rapidly evolving, with memes gaining prominence as a distinctive form. Unfortunately, some malicious users exploit memes to target individuals or vulnerable communities, making it imperative to identify and address such instances of hateful memes. Extensive research has been conducted to address this issue by developing hate meme detection models. However, a notable limitation of traditional machine/deep learning models is the requirement for labeled datasets for accurate classification. Recently, the research community has witnessed the emergence of several visual language models that have exhibited outstanding performance across various tasks. In this study, we aim to investigate the efficacy of these visual language models in handling intricate tasks such as hate meme detection. We use various prompt settings to focus on zero-shot classification of hateful/harmful memes. Through our anal",
