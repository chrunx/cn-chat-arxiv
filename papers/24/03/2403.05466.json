In our method, robots are represented by 3D points on their link surfaces. The task space of a robot is represented by a point cloud that can be obtained from depth sensors. Using the point-cloud representation, goal reaching in grasping can be formulated as point matching, while collision avoidance can be efficiently achieved by querying the signed distance values of the robot points in the signed distance field of the scene points. Consequently, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to solve the joint motion and grasp planning problem. The advantage of our method is that the point-cloud representation is general to be used with any robot in any environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing experiments on a tabletop scene and a shelf scene for graspin",

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种基于点云的机器人抓取轨迹优化方法，该方法通过将机器人表示为链接表面的3D点，以及使用深度传感器获得的点云来表示机器人任务空间。通过这种点云表示，抓取目标定位可以简化为点匹配问题，而碰撞回避则可通过查询机器人点在场景点 signed distance 场中的 signed distance 值来实现。这种方法通过对关节运动和抓取规划问题进行约束的非线性优化来解决。其主要创新之处在于该方法对任何类型的机器人和环境都具有普适性。文章通过在桌面和架子上进行的实验展示了该方法的有效性。"
