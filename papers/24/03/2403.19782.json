The emergence of deep learning leads to significant progress in self-driving cars. Conventional deep learning-based methods handle lane detection problems as a binary segmentation task and determine whether a pixel belongs to a line. These methods rely on the assumption of a fixed number of lanes, which does not always work. This study aims to develop an optimal structure for the lane detection problem, offering a promising solution for driver assistance features in modern vehicles by utilizing a machine learning method consisting of binary segmentation and Affinity Fields that can manage varying numbers of lanes and lane change scenarios.
