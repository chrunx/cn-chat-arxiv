Mainly phenomenological models with many parameters are widely used by far, while theoretical models are not so practical. In arXiv:1902.08477, a theoretical equation of state with only one parameter is derived from Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, as an application of AdS/QCD, where pointlike instanton case is taken into consideration. When the tidal deformability constraint from gravitational wave event is satisfied, the maximum mass is about 1.7 solar masses. Now we upgrade this model to instanton gas, with one more variable, the instanton width. This is not naively a free parameter, but a function of the chemical potential. Thus we end up with a more complicated and accurate model, but still with only one adjustable parameter. In this case, we find the maximum mass becomes 1.85 solar mas",
