Here, we extend this framework by proposing that object space may also be defined by embodied features, specifically action possibilities that objects afford to an agent (i.e., affordance) and their spatial relation with the agent (i.e., situatedness). To test this proposal, we quantified the embodied features with a set of action atoms. We found that embodied features explained the subjective similarity among familiar objects along with the objects' visual features. This observation was further replicated with novel objects.
