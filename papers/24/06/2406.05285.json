A highly accurate and clinically applicable segmentation foundation model will greatly facilitate clinicians and researchers using CT images. Although existing foundation models have attracted great interest, none are adequate for 3D CT, either because they lack accurate automatic segmentation for large cohort analysis or the ability to segment novel classes. An ideal segmentation solution should possess two features: accurate out-of-the-box performance covering major organ classes, and effective adaptation or zero-shot ability to novel structures. To achieve this goal, we introduce Versatile Imaging SegmenTation and Annotation model (VISTA3D).
