Most of DML methods for CBIR rely on a high number of annotated images to accurately learn model parameters of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, gathering such data is time-consuming and costly. To address this, we propose an annotation cost-efficient active learning (ANNEAL) method tailored to DML-driven CBIR in RS.

The informativeness of image pairs is evaluated by combining uncertainty and diversity criteria.
