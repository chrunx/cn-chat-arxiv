We study the influence of AI on the study habits, class choices, and career prospects of Harvard undergraduates (n=326), finding that almost 90% of students use generative AI. For roughly 25% of these students, AI has begun to substitute for attending office hours and completing required readings. Half of students are concerned that AI will negatively impact their job prospects, and over half of students wish that Harvard had more classes on the future impacts of AI. We also investigate students' outlook on the broader social implications of AI, finding that half of students are worried that AI will increase economic inequality, and 40% believe that extinction risk from AI should be treated as a global priority with the same urgency as pandemics and nuclear war. Around half of students who have taken a class on AI expect AI to exceed human capabilities on almos",

    "tldr": "该文章研究了生成式AI对哈佛大学本科生学习习惯、课程选择和职业前景的积极影响。调查发现，近90%的学生使用生成式AI，其中约25%的学生开始用AI替代出席课后辅导和完成阅读作业。超过一半的学生担心AI可能对他们未来的就业产生负面影响，并且还有一半的学生希望哈佛大学提供更多关于AI未来影响的课程。此外，文章还探讨了学生对AI更广泛的社会影响的看法，其中约一半的学生担忧AI可能会加剧经济不平等，而40%的学生认为AI的潜在灭绝风险应与流行病和核战争的紧迫度同等对待。大约一半的AI课程学生预计AI将在多个领域超越人类能力。"
