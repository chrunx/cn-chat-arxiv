We study the algebra preserved by the defect CFT supported on the line, identify the superdisplacement multiplet and discuss some of its weak-coupling realizations. By employing a superspace description, we present the 4-point functions of the superdisplacement and show how they are determined by functions of cross-ratios. Within an analytic bootstrap approach, we derive these functions at leading and next-to-leading order at strong coupling, obtaining a result in agreement with appropriate orbifolds of the ABJM case considered in arXiv:2004.07849.",

    "tldr": "该文章通过计算N=4 Chern-Simons-matter理论中1/2 BPS Wilson线的局部插入物关联函数，研究了在该线支持下的缺陷CFT的守恒律，识别了超级位移多重态，并讨论了其弱耦合环境的实现形式。通过使用超空间描述，文章展示了超级位移四点函数，并表明了它们是如何由交叉比函数决定的。通过分析性质bootstrap方法，文章在强耦合时得到了这些函数的leading和next-to-leading阶的结果，这与arXiv:2004.07849中考虑的ABJM情形相符。"
