We propose a multi-layer knowledge pyramid approach within the RAG framework to achieve a better balance between precision and recall. The knowledge pyramid consists of three layers: Ontologies, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), and chunk-based raw text. We employ cross-layer augmentation techniques for comprehensive knowledge coverage and dynamic updates of the Ontology schema and instances. To ensure compactness, we utilize cross-layer filtering methods for knowledge condensation in KGs. Our approach, named PolyRAG, follows a waterfall model for retrieval, starting from the top of the pyramid and progressing down until a confident answer is obtained.

    "tldr": "该文章提出了一种名为PolyRAG的多层次检索方法，通过在RAG框架中构建知识金字塔，包括奥顿学、知识图和文本层，以提高检索的精度和召回率。这种方法通过跨层知识更新的动态处理和紧凑的知识图过滤方法，为现有方法提供了重要的改进，尤其是针对领域特定的知识检索任务，证明了该方法的有效性。"
