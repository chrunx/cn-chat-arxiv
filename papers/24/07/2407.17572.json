    "abstract": "arXiv:2407.17572v3 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: Generating a realistic, large-scale 3D virtual city remains a complex challenge due to the involvement of numerous 3D assets, various city styles, and strict layout constraints. Existing approaches provide promising attempts at procedural content generation to create large-scale scenes using Blender agents. However, they face crucial issues such as difficulties in scaling up generation capability and achieving fine-grained control at the semantic layout level. To address these problems, we propose a novel multi-modal controllable procedural content generation method, named CityX, which enhances realistic, unbounded 3D city generation guided by multiple layout conditions, including OSM, semantic maps, and satellite images. Specifically, the proposed method contains a general protocol for integrating various PCG plugins and a multi-agent framework for transforming instructions into executable Blender actions.
