Many of the MDA-MB-231 spindles exhibit rapid lateral twisting during metaphase, which remains unaffected by knockdown of the oncogene Myc and treatment with inhibitors of the serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), alone or in any combination. The MDA-MB-231 cells are the most aggressive and rapidly form metastatic tumors in xenograft transplant models, and exhibited very high proliferation rates when plated as three-dimensional cultures in Matrigel. Quantitative image analysis of microtubules (MTs) in six BC cell lines - MDA-MB-231 (receptor negative), HCC-1143 (receptor negative), HCC-3153 (receptor negative), ZR75B (estrogen receptor-positive), LY2 (progesterone receptor-positive), HCC-1428 (estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-positive) - ",
