Here, we propose that use-dependent biases can be understood as a rational strategy for movement under limitations on the capacity to process sensory information to guide motor output. We adopt an information-theoretic approach to characterize sensorimotor information processing and determine how behavior should be optimized given limitations to this capacity.
