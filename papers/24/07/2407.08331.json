    "tldr": "该文章提出了一个结合自适应进化策略（ES）和大型语言模型（LLM）的方法，以增强优化过程的可解释性。通过使用具有重启机制的自适应ES，本方法能够有效地在强大的基准函数 landscapes 上导航。这种方法能够捕获详细的活动日志，包括优化历程的 fitness 演变、 step-size 的调整以及由于停滞引起的重启事件。然后，大型语言模型被用于处理这些日志，生成清晰、友好的总结，这些总结突出强调了关键方面，如 convergence behavior、最优 fitness 成就以及遭遇局部最优点的实例。通过在 Rastrigin 函数上的案例研究，本研究展示了如何通过 LLM 使用该方法，实现对 ES 优化复杂性的透明化。研究结果强调了大型语言模型在先进优化算法与它们的可解释性方面发挥潜在桥梁作用的潜力。"
