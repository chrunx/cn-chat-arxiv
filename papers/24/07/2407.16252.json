This limitation prevents an authentic consultation experience. Additionally, extant Chinese legal LLMs suffer from critical limitations: (1) insufficient control over the quality of instruction fine-tuning data; (2) increased model hallucination resulting from users' ambiguous queries; and (3) a reduction in the model's ability to follow instructions over multiple dialogue turns.
