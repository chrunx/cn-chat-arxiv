    "title": "Perm: A Parametric Representation for Multi-Style 3D Hair Modeling",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2407.19451v3 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: We present Perm, a learned parametric model of human 3D hair designed to facilitate various hair-related applications. Unlike previous work that jointly models the global hair shape and local strand details, we propose to disentangle them using a PCA-based strand representation in the frequency domain, thereby allowing more precise editing and output control. Specifically, we leverage our strand representation to fit and decompose hair geometry textures into low- to high-frequency hair structures. These decomposed textures are later parameterized with different generative models, emulating common stages in the hair modeling process. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the architecture design of \\textsc{Perm}, and finally deploy the trained model as a generic prior to solve task-agnostic problems, further showcasing its flexibility and superiority in tasks such as 3D hair parameterization, hairstyle interpolation, single-view",

    "tldr": "该文章介绍了Perm，一个用于3D头发建模的参数化表示，它能够支持各种头发相关应用。文章提出了一种新的方法来分离头发的大致形状和局部细丝细节，这种方法使用频率域中的PCA（主分量分析）基细丝表示，从而允许更精确的编辑和输出控制。通过使用一个专门的细丝表示来适合和分解头发的几何纹理，以及将其分割成低频到高频的头发结构，并使用不同的生成模型对这些分解后的纹理进行参数化，从而模拟头发建模过程中常见的步骤。通过广泛的实验验证了Perm架构的设计，并最终将其作为通用先验部署到诸如3D头发参数化、发型插值和单视角渲染等任务中，进一步展示了它在众多任务中的灵活性和优越性。"
