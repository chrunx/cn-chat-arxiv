It facilitates effective AI utilization within sovereign networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources, leveraging: 1) personal data stores to ensure data sovereignty, where data remains securely within Participants' control; 2) a scalable federated learning protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training, where only model parameter updates are shared, keeping data within the personal data stores; and 3) a scalable, trustless cryptographic rewards mechanism on a public blockchain to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution through a decentralized auditing protocol.
