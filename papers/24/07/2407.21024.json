However, a research gap exists to support fully autonomous GIS agents: how to enable agents to discover and download the necessary data for geospatial analyses. This study proposes an autonomous GIS agent framework capable of retrieving required geospatial data by generating, executing, and debugging programs. The framework utilizes the LLM as the decision-maker, selects the appropriate data source (s) from a pre-defined source list, and fetches the data from the chosen source. Each data source has a handbook that records the metadata and technical details for data retrieval. The proposed framework is designed in a plug-and-play style to ensure flexibility and extensibility. Human users or autonomous data scrawlers can add new data sources by addin",
