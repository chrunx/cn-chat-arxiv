While commercial LLMs like ChatGPT have dominated this domain, open-source alternatives have lagged considerably in performance, limiting the flexibility and data privacy of this emerging technology. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing reinforcement learning with golden code feedback to enhance the performance of pre-trained models. Leveraging open-source data and base models, we have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with a substantial margin. Notably, our 6.7B parameter model \\ours{} demonstrates superior performance compared to current best-in-class 13B and 16B models. Furthermore, through a comprehensive analysis of the limitations in direct fine-tuning and the training dynamics of reinforcement",
