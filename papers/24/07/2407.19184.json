Early detection and assessment of forest fires are crucial for effective management and conservation efforts. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced computer vision algorithms offer a promising solution for forest fire detection and assessment. In this paper, we optimize an integrated forest fire risk assessment framework using UAVs and multi-stage object detection algorithms. We introduce improvements to our previous framework, including the adoption of Faster R-CNN, Grid R-CNN, Sparse R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN, Dynamic R-CNN, and Libra R-CNN detectors, and explore optimizations such as CBAM for attention enhancement, random erasing for preprocessing, and different color space representations. We evaluate these enhancements through extensive experimentation using aerial image footage from various regions in British Columbia, Canad",
