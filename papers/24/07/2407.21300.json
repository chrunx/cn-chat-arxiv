However, it also has many problems: it consumes a lot of memory because of the huge database. When faced with massive streaming data, it is unable to update the established index database in time. To save the memory of building the database and maintain accuracy simultaneously, we proposed a new approach combining a streaming algorithm and k-means cluster with RAG. Our approach applies a streaming algorithm to update the index and reduce memory consumption. Then use the k-means algorithm to cluster documents with high similarities together, the query time will be shortened by doing this. We conducted comparative experiments on four methods, and the results show that RAG with streaming algorithm and k-means cluster performs well in accuracy and memory. For mass",
