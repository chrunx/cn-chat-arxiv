The TAS evaluates the translation accuracy independently of the rotations, and the RAS evaluates the rotation accuracy independently of the translations. The PAS is the average of the two scores, evaluating the combined accuracy of both translations and rotations. The TAS is computed in four steps: (1) Find the upper quartile of the closest-pair-distances, $d$. (2) Align the estimated trajectory to the ground truth using a robust registration method. (3) Collect all distance errors and obtain the cumulative frequencies for multiple thresholds ranging from $0.01d$ to $d$ with a resolution $0.01d$. (4) Add up these cumulative frequencies and normalize them such that the theoretical maximum is 1. The TAS has practical",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出三种新的度量方法，用于评估给定地面真值的情况下估计相机姿态集的准确性。这三种度量方法是翻译对齐分数（TAS）、旋转对齐分数（RAS）和姿态对齐分数（PAS）。TAS独立评估翻译的准确性，而RAS独立评估旋转的准确性，PAS则是两者分数的平均值，用于评估翻译和旋转的整体准确性。TAS的计算步骤如下：（1）找到最近对距离的上四分位数，d。（2）使用稳健注册方法对估计的轨迹进行对齐，使其与地面真值对齐。（3）收集所有距离误差，并获取从0.01d到d的多个阈值范围内的累积频数，分辨率是0.01d。（4）将这些累积频数相加并对其进行归一化处理，确保理论上的最大值是1。TAS在实践中具有很高的稳健性和可靠性，可以帮助我们对相机姿态估计的结果进行更客观的评价。",
