    "abstract": "arXiv:2407.20391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: We propose three novel metrics for evaluating the accuracy of a set of estimated camera poses given the ground truth: Translation Alignment Score (TAS), Rotation Alignment Score (RAS), and Pose Alignment Score (PAS). The TAS evaluates the translation accuracy independently of the rotations, and the RAS evaluates the rotation accuracy independently of the translations. The PAS is the average of the two scores, evaluating the combined accuracy of both translations and rotations. The TAS is computed in four steps: (1) Find the upper quartile of the closest-pair-distances, $d$. (2) Align the estimated trajectory to the ground truth using a robust registration method. (3) Collect all distance errors and obtain the cumulative frequencies for multiple thresholds ranging from $0.01d$ to $d$ with a resolution $0.01d$. (4) Add up these cumulative frequencies and normalize them such that the theoretical maximum is 1. The TAS has practical",
