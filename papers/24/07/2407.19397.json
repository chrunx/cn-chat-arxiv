Traditional unsupervised domain adaptive detection methods often struggle with this shift, leading to suboptimal outcomes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel domain adaptive approach for lung nodule detection that leverages mean teacher self-training and contrastive learning. First, we propose a hierarchical contrastive learning strategy to refine nodule representations and enhance the distinction between nodules and background. Second, we introduce a nodule-level domain-invariant feature learning (NDL) module to capture domain-invariant features through adversarial learning across different domains. Additionally, we propose a new annotated dataset of X-ray images to aid in advancing lung nodule detection re",
