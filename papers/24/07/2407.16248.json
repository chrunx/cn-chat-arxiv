Accurately identifying the products being sold by salespeople, i.e., livestreaming product retrieval (LPR), poses a fundamental and daunting challenge. The LPR task encompasses three primary dilemmas in real-world scenarios: 1) the recognition of intended products from distractor products present in the background; 2) the video-image heterogeneity that the appearance of products showcased in live streams often deviates substantially from standardized product images in stores; 3) there are numerous confusing products with subtle visual nuances in the shop. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatiotemporal Graphing Multi-modal Network (SGMN). First, we employ a text-guided attention mechanism that leverages the spoken content of salespeople to guide the model to focus toward intended products, emphasizing their s",
