However, due to the projection process of X-ray imaging, much spatial information has been lost. To accurately provide efficient spinal morphological and structural information, reconstructing the 3-D structures of the spine from the 2-D X-ray images is essential. It is challenging for current reconstruction methods to preserve the edge information and local shapes of the asymmetrical vertebrae structures. In this study, we propose a new Edge-Aware Reconstruction network (EAR) to focus on the performance improvement of the edge information and vertebrae shapes. In our network, by using the auto-encoder architecture as the backbone, the edge attention module and frequency enhancement module are proposed to strengthen the perception of the edge reconstruction.
