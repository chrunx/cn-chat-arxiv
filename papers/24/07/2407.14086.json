However, solving the competition between the detector and the feature extractor has always been a challenge. Meanwhile, the issue of directly embedding the ReID task into MOT has remained unresolved. The lack of high discriminability in appearance features results in their limited utility. In this paper, a new learning approach using cross-correlation to capture temporal information of objects is proposed. The feature extraction network is no longer trained solely on appearance features from each frame but learns richer motion features by utilizing feature heatmaps from consecutive frames, which addresses t",
