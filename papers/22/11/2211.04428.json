    "abstract": "arXiv:2211.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Coreference resolution (CR), identifying expressions referring to the same real-world entity, is a fundamental challenge in natural language processing (NLP). This paper explores the latest advancements in CR, spanning coreference and anaphora resolution. We critically analyze the diverse corpora that have fueled CR research, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and suitability for various tasks. We examine the spectrum of evaluation metrics used to assess CR systems, emphasizing their advantages, disadvantages, and the need for more nuanced, task-specific metrics. Tracing the evolution of CR algorithms, we provide a detailed overview of methodologies, from rule-based approaches to cutting-edge deep learning architectures. We delve into mention-pair, entity-based, cluster-ranking, sequence-to-sequence, and graph neural network models, elucidating their theoretical foundations and performance on benchmark datasets.
